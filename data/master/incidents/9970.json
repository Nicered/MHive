Pozo\n**판결일**: 2001-10-24\n**법원**: Ohio Court of Appeals\n**관할**: Ohio, OH\n\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n[EDITOR'S NOTE: This case is unpublished as indicated by the issuing court.]                             JUDGMENT ENTRY.\nThis appeal, considered on the accelerated calendar under App.R. 11.1(E) and Loc.R. 12, is not controlling authority except as provided in S.Ct.R.Rep.Op. 2(G)(1).\nWillie R.

Reliability is the linchpin in determining the admissibility of identification testimony, and even if the identification procedure itself was suggestive, so long as the challenged identification itself is reliable, it is admissible.  Manson v. Brathwaite (1977), 432 U.S. 98, 97 S.Ct. 2243.\n  Following a review of the record, we cannot say that the identification procedures employed by the police were impermissibly suggestive, or that the witnesses' ultimate identifications of Pozo as the perpetrator were unreliable.
