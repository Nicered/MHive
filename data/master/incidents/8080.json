Getman\n**판결일**: 2005-12-27\n**법원**: Michigan Supreme Court\n**관할**: Michigan, MI\n\n## 인용\n\n- 706 N.W.2d 834\n- 474 Mich. 971\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\n706 N.W.2d 834 (2005)\n474 Mich. 971\nPEOPLE of the State of Michigan, Plaintiff-Appellee,\nv.\nJames Richard GETMAN, Defendant-Appellant.\nDocket No. 129784, COA No. 261626.\nSupreme Court of Michigan.\nDecember 27, 2005.\nOn order of the Court, the application for leave to appeal the October 14, 2005 *835 order of the Court of Appeals is considered and, pursuant to MCR 7.302(G)(1), in lieu of granting leave to appeal, we VACATE the Calhoun Circuit Court's order of February 10, 2005, and REMAND this case to the Calhoun Circuit Court for consideration of the merits of defendant's motion for relief from judgment filed on December 13, 2004. Because the court did not rule on defendant's motion to withdraw guilty plea filed on August 24, 2004, or defendant's motion for relief from judgment filed on September 14, 2004, the Calhoun Circuit Court erred in dismissing defendant's motion for relief from judgment filed on December 13, 2004.\nWe do not retain jurisdiction.\n...",
