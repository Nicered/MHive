  "description": "## 사건 정보\n\n**사건명**: Tyrell J. Dever v. State\n**판결일**: 2019-03-13\n**법원**: Court of Appeals of Texas\n**관할**: Texas, TX\n\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n                                  IN THE\n                          TENTH COURT OF APPEALS\n\n                                 No. 10-19-00072-CR\n\nTYRELL J. DEVER,\n                                                             Appellant\nv.\n\nTHE STATE OF TEXAS,\n                                                             Appellee\n\n\n\n                           From the 54th District Court\n                            McLennan County, Texas\n                           Trial Court No. 2016-1869-C2\n\n\n                          MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n      On February 25, 2019, Tyrell J. Dever filed a pro se notice of appeal of his conviction\n\nfor murder. Dever’s imposition of sentence was on October 29, 2018, and the judgment\n\nof conviction was signed the same day. Dever’s notice of appeal is therefore untimely,\n\nand we have no jurisdiction of an untimely appeal. See TEX. R. APP. P. 26.2(a); Olivo v.\n\nState, 918 S.W.2d 519, 522 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996) (no appellate jurisdiction where notice\n\nof appeal is untimely). For the reasons stated, this appeal is dismissed.\n\f        Notwithstanding that we are dismissing this appeal, Dever may file a motion for\n\nrehearing with this Court within 15 days after this opinion and judgment are rendered if\n\nhe believes this opinion and judgment are erroneously based on inaccurate information\n\nor documents. See TEX. R. APP. P. 49.1. Moreover, if Dever desires to have the opinion\n\nand judgment of this Court reviewed by filing a petition for discretionary review...",
