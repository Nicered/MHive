STATE of Missouri\n**판결일**: 1988-06-29\n**법원**: Missouri Court of Appeals\n**관할**: Missouri, MO\n\n**판사**: Flanigan, Hogan, Maus, Prewitt\n\n## 변호인\n\nDan J.

Mercer v. State, 666 S.W.2d 942, 944 (Mo.App.1984).\nMovant states in his first point that the trial court erred in denying his motion because he was denied his right to effective assistance of counsel as his attorney failed to interview two “key” witnesses.
