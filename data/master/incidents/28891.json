MILLER\n**판결일**: 1914-01-26\n**법원**: Appellate Terms of the Supreme Court of New York\n**관할**: New York, NY\n\n**판사**: Bijur, Lehman\n\n## 변호인\n\nSamuel Deutsch, of New York City, for appellant., Jacob Marx, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n## 인용\n\n- 145 N.Y.S. 934\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\nBIJUR, J.\nThis case was placed upon the calendar and noticed for trial by plaintiff five years after issue joined, and long after junior issues had been tried. Defendant waited for about a year thereafter before making this motion. Plaintiff claims that defendant is barred by laches from succeeding on this motion. All, however, that can be maintained on that score is that the court should have taken defendant’s delay into consideration; and I see no reason for disturbing the judge’s exercise of his discretion under the circumstances.\nThe order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.\nPAGE, J., concurs.\n...",
