State\n**판결일**: 2009-10-14\n**법원**: Court of Appeals of Texas\n**관할**: Texas, TX\n\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n                                 IN THE\n                         TENTH COURT OF APPEALS\n\n                                No. 10-08-00406-CR\n\nERIC DEWAYNE CARROLL,\n                                                          Appellant\nv.\n\nTHE STATE OF TEXAS,\n                                                          Appellee\n\n\n\n                        From the 272nd District Court\n                             Brazos County, Texas\n                       Trial Court No. 08-02263-CRF-272\n\n\n                          MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n\n      A jury convicted Eric Dewayne Carroll of burglary of a habitation, and the trial\n\ncourt sentenced him to twenty years in prison.

In one\n\npoint, Carroll contends that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting Davis’s\n\ftestimony under Rule 803(24) and in violation of Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36,\n\n124 S.
