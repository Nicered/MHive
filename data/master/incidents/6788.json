  "description": "## 사건 정보\n\n**사건명**: Jose S. Zavala v. Dawn Ann Shevlin\n**판결일**: 2008-06-17\n**법원**: Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York\n**관할**: New York, NY\n\n## 인용\n\n- 52 A.D.3d 702\n- 858 N.Y.S.2d 897\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\nIn an action to recover damages for personal injuries, the defendant appeals from an order of the Supreme Court, Nassau County (Woodard, J.), entered November 19, 2007, which denied her motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint on the ground that the plaintiff did not sustain a serious injury within the meaning of Insurance Law § 5102 (d).\nOrdered that the order is affirmed, with costs.\nThe defendant met her prima facie burden by showing that the plaintiff did not sustain a serious injury within the meaning of Insurance Law § 5102 (d) as a result of the subject accident (see Toure v Avis Rent A Car Sys., 98 NY2d 345 [2002]; Gaddy v Eyler, 79 NY2d 955, 956-957 [1992]). However, in opposition, the plaintiff raised a triable issue of fact. Fisher, J.E, Florio, Angiolillo, Dickerson and Helen, JJ., concur. [See 2007 NY Slip Op 33747(11).]\n...",
