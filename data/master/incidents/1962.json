PEDRO ALVARDO-VALLE v. THE STATE.\n\n       Pedro Alvardo-Valle pled guilty to criminal attempt to commit kidnapping with\nbodily injury and aggravated assault in 2017.         Alvardo-Valle filed a motion to\nwithdraw his guilty plea. The trial court dismissed the motion, and Alvardo-Valle\nfiled a timely application for discretionary review.1\n       Based on the trial court’s order denying Alvardo-Valle’s motion to withdraw\nhis guilty plea, the motion was filed outside the term of court of his judgment of\nconviction. See Ellison v. State, 283 Ga. 461, 461 (660 SE2d 373) (2008) (noting that\na motion to withdraw a guilty plea must be filed in the same term of court in which\nthe plea was entered and a trial court lacks jurisdiction to grant an untimely motion).\nHowever, orders resolving out-of-time motions to withdraw guilty pleas have been\ntreated by our Supreme Court as directly appealable. See id.; Smith v. State, 283 Ga.\n376, 376-377 (659 SE2d 380) (2008). Thus, it appears that the trial court’s order is\nsubject to direct appeal.\n       We will grant an otherwise timely application for discretionary appeal if the\nlower court’s order is subject to direct appeal. See OCGA § 5-6-35 (j). Accordingly,\nthis application is hereby GRANTED, a...",
