AP-76,363\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEx parte MICHAEL WAYNE BOHANNAN, Applicant\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON APPLICATION FOR A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS\r\n\r\nTARRANT COUNTY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tKeller, P.J., filed a concurring opinion.\r\n\r\n\tIn Ex parte Cordova, a parolee was arrested on a parole revocation warrant, and new criminal\r\ncharges were pending at the time. (1)  There is no suggestion in our opinion in that case that the parolee\r\nwas being confined on the new charges. (2)  In the present case, however, appellant was being confined\r\non the new charge.  Whether that difference between the two cases is legally significant is a question\r\nto be resolved at another time because, as the Court correctly points out, this case is moot.\r\n\r\nFiled: May 11, 2011\r\n\r\nPublish\r\n1.   Ex parte Cordova, 235 S.W.3d 735 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). \r\n2.   An examination of the writ file in Cordova shows that the new charges were in a different\r\ncounty than the county of confinement, the latter of which had issued the parole revocation warrant.\r\n\r\n\r\n...",
