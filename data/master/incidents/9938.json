App'x 556\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\nORDER\nThe district court denied Seetrie Curry’s motion to vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C. § 2255, but in January 2001 we granted a certificate of appealability on the following issue: “Whether trial counsel was ineffective, in light of Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and United States v. Nance, 236 F.3d 820 (2000), for failing to object to the exclusion of drug quantities in the indictment.” We now affirm the district court’s denial of Curry’s § 2255 motion.\nIn the late 1980s Curry was a member of Chicago’s “Undertaker Vice Lords” gang and participated in its narcotics trafficking business by selling heroin and cocaine. See United States v. Richardson, 130 F.3d 765 (7th Cir.1997) (direct appeal). In 1995 Curry and several other gang members were convicted of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and other offenses for their involvement in the drug ring, and Curry received a sentence of life imprisonment. Id. at 771. After his unsuccessful direct appeal, Curry filed a pro se § 2255 motion, arguing that trial counsel was ineffective. As relevant here, Curry argued that counsel was ineffective for failing to object at sentencing that the indictment did not list Curry’s previous convictions, which the district court used to enhance his sentence.\nIn December 1999 the district court denied Curry’s § 2255 motion on the merits, relying on Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), and Edwards...",
