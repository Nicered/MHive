  "description": "## 사건 정보\n\n**사건명**: Amazeen & A. v. Newcastle & A\n**판결일**: 1911-12-05\n**법원**: Supreme Court of New Hampshire\n**관할**: New Hampshire, NH\n\n**판사**: Parsons\n\n## 변호인\n\nPage, Bartlett & Mitchell and Ernest L. Guptill, for the plaintiffs., Kelley, Harding & Hatch, for the defendants.\n\n## 인용\n\n- 81 A. 1079\n- 76 N.H. 250\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\nThe allegations of want of capacity in Mrs. Martin to make the conveyance, of fraud in procuring its execution, and of mistake in its form having been found against the plaintiffs, the only grounds upon which they now attack the validity of the deed are that the selectmen were not authorized by vote of the town to make the contract for support found to be its consideration, or to accept the conveyance. This means that the deed was without consideration and was never delivered as matter of law.\nThe first objection is not open to the plaintiffs claiming as heirs of the grantor. \"A deed duly executed is conclusive evidence of the consideration against the maker; not indeed as to the amount, but as to the fact of the consideration paid; so that, as between the parties and those claiming under them, the consideration cannot be impeached for the purpose of defeating the conveyance.\" Prescott v. Hayes, 43 N.H. 593, 596, 597; Farrington v. Barr, 36 N.H. 86; Graves v. Graves, 29 N.H. 129, 144; Runnells v. Bosquet, 60 N.H. 38, 39. Moreover, the contract for support found to have been the consideration of the conveyance has been fully performed by the grantee, the town. Mrs. Martin could have made the conveyance without any consideration, and the gift would have been valid as against these plaintiffs. As she made the conveyance for a consideration which she deemed adequate and which was paid her in full, it is immaterial if such consideration has proved to be less onerous to the grantee...",
