Titus v. State,  117 Ala. 16 ,  23 So. 77 ; Justice v. State,  99 Ala. 180 ,  13 So. 658 ; Young v. State,  95 Ala. 4 , 10 So. 913 . Dying declarations are admissible only in a case where the evidence would be competent if the declarant was on the witness stand. A mere conclusion or an expression of opinion or belief of a dying\n\n## 인용\n\n- 101 So. 108\n- 211 Ala. 555\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\nAppellant was jointly indicted with his father for the murder of one Ab. Giles. There was a severance. Defendant did not deny the shooting, but pleaded self-defense, and appellant's trial resulted in a conviction of murder in the second degree, from which this appeal is prosecuted.\nThe defendant, with his father, and members of their respective families, were touring in two automobiles from Atlanta, Ga., to a point in Mississippi, and while upon a narrow hill on a public road in Cleburne county met the deceased, there being a collision between the car of the deceased and that of the defendant's father. The parties were strangers. After the passing of a few words a difficulty ensued, in which the deceased received two pistol shot wounds, one in the neck and the other in the chest, either of which, according to the evidence of the physician, was sufficient to produce death.\nThe difficulty occurred about 2:30 o'clock in the afternoon of Sunday, June 17, 1923. He received the attention of a physician about 4 o'clock the same afternoon, and died at 10 o'clock that night. The attending physician testified as to these mortal wounds, and that the deceased told him he was going to die. The physician also informed the deceased of his impending death. The court was fully justified in the light of this preliminary proof in admitting the evidence of the physician as to the dying declarations of the deceased. Gerald v. State, 128 Ala. 6, 29 So. 614; Patterson v. State,171 Ala. 2, 54 So. 69...",
