  "description": "## 사건 정보\n\n**사건명**: Karolina Kuszewska v. Steiger Hotel Operating Co., Inc.\n**판결일**: 1934-06-14\n**법원**: Appellate Terms of the Supreme Court of New York\n**관할**: New York, NY\n\n## 변호인\n\nKramer & Kleinfield [Bertram A. Levine of counsel], for the appellant., Charles S. Pryor, for the respondent.\n\n## 인용\n\n- 152 Misc. 80\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\nPer Curiam.\nThe statute (Lien Law, § 181) provides that the keeper of an apartment hotel shall have a hen for charges due on account of accommodation, food, lodging and extras furnished. It does not purport to give a hen for rent or telephone charges in a case where, as here, the apartment was occupied under a yearly lease creating the relation of landlord and tenant. It is unnecessary to decide the remaining questions as to whether the statute could, within constitutional limitations, grant a hen not recognized at common law that would attach to the property of third persons.\nJudgment reversed, with thirty dollars costs, and judgment ordered for plaintiff awarding to her possession of the chattels described in the complaint, and dismissing the counterclaim on the merits, with costs.\nAh concur; present, Callahan, Frankenthaler and Shientag, JJ.\n...",
