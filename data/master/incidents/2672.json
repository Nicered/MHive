See Washington v. State, No. 01–13–00369–CR, 2014 WL\n\n4658476 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] Sept. 18, 2014, no pet.).

He claims he contacted the court clerk who\n\n    allegedly told him the case had been closed. Washington does not state what\n\n    motions were filed and includes no record.\n\n         Washington has not established his right to mandamus relief because he has\n\nnot provided an adequate record.
