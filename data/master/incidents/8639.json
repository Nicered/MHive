Briley, Kenneth R.\n**판결일**: 2004-11-17\n**법원**: Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\n**관할**: USA, Federal\n\n**판사**: Per Curiam\n\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n                            In the\n United States Court of Appeals\n              For the Seventh Circuit\n                         ____________\n\nNo. 02-2981\nJAMES PERRUQUET,\n                                           Petitioner-Appellant,\n                               v.\n\nKENNETH R. BRILEY,\n                                          Respondent-Appellee.\n\n                         ____________\n           Appeal from the United States District Court\n                 for the Central District of Illinois.\n            No. 01 C 1406—Michael M. Mihm, Judge.\n                         ____________\n  ARGUED JANUARY 9, 2004—DECIDED NOVEMBER 17, 2004\n                     ____________\n\n\n\n  Before POSNER, RIPPLE, and ROVNER, Circuit Judges.\n   ROVNER, Circuit Judge. Petitioner James Perruquet\nstabbed Christopher Hudson to death during a struggle in\n1995, and an Illinois jury later found Perruquet guilty of\nfirst-degree murder. Perruquet now seeks a writ of habeas\ncorpus, asserting in relevant part that the state trial court\ndeprived him of due process when it refused to admit evidence\nand instruct the jury on self-defense. The district court\nconcluded that Perruquet had not adequately made out a\ndue process claim and that, even if he had, the claim was\nwithout merit. We conclude that Perruquet procedurally\ndefaulted the due process claim by not fairly presenting it to\nthe Illinois courts.\n\f2                                               No. 02-2981\n\n                             I.\n  Perruquet...",
