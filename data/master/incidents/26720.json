Berry King, Atty. Gen., for the State.\n\n## 인용\n\n- 290 P. 348\n- 48 Okla. Crim. 154\n- 290 P. 318\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\nThe plaintiff in error, hereinafter referred to as the defendant, was charged by information with possession of about one and one-half pints of intoxicating liquor, to wit, whisky, with the intent on the part of the defendant to sell, give away, transport, and otherwise unlawfully furnish to others; was convicted and sentenced to pay a fine of $200 and costs of prosecution, *Page 155 \nand be confined in the county jail for a term of 90 days. From which judgment and sentence the defendant has appealed.\nThe witnesses on behalf of the state testify they went to the rooming house of the defendant, on the 22d day of November, 1928, and found a pint and a half pint of whisky in room No. 1, near the center of the room in a chair where some blankets were piled; there was a second-hand store below the rooming house, and the stairway to the rooming house went up on the outside of the building.\nThis is, in substance, the testimony offered by the state. The defendant demurred to the evidence of the state and requested the court to advise the jury to return a verdict of not guilty in this case for the reason that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the charge in the information, and insufficient to prove a crime against the laws of the state. The demurrer was overruled and defendant duly excepted.\nThe defendant then testified in his own behalf and stated he occupied room No. 2, in the rooming house, and that there was no whisky in his room. Defendant did not know who was in room No. 1...",
