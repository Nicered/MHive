WR-83,798-03\n\n\n                            EX PARTE BASILIO CRUZ, Applicant\n\n\n               ON APPLICATION FOR A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS\n            CAUSE NO. 2018-DCR-00222-A IN THE 107TH DISTRICT COURT\n                           FROM CAMERON COUNTY\n\n\n       Per curiam.\n\n                                           OPINION\n\n       Applicant was convicted of one count of possession of marihuana and one count of\n\npossession of cocaine and sentenced to five years’ imprisonment for each count. Applicant filed\n\nthis application for a writ of habeas corpus in the county of conviction, and the district clerk\n\nforwarded it to this Court. See TEX . CODE CRIM . PROC. art. 11.07.\n\n       Applicant contends that counsel was ineffective and that law enforcement violated his Fourth\n\nAmendment rights. Applicant does not allege facts which, if true, would entitle him to relief. Ex\n\nparte Maldonado, 688 S.W.2d 114, 116 (Tex. Crim. App. 1985). Nevertheless, the State and trial\n\ncourt recommend that Applicant be granted relief because he agreed to an illegal sentence. It is\n\napparent from the face of the record that Applicant is entitled to relief.\n\f                                                                                                  2\n\n       Relief is granted.
