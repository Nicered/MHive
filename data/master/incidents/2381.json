BERTHA SULLIVAN v. THE STATE.\n\n      In 2012, Bertha Sullivan pleaded guilty to four counts of financial identity\nfraud, two counts of forgery in the first degree, and three counts of felony theft by\nconversion. The trial court sentenced Sullivan to a total of twenty years of probation\nalong with restitution and costs. Sullivan’s probation was subsequently revoked in\nfull in January 2017. Thereafter, Sullivan filed a “Motion to Reduce/Modify\nSentence.” The trial court denied Sullivan’s motion and she filed this direct appeal.\nWe, however, lack jurisdiction.\n      In construing pleadings, substance controls over nomenclature. Kuriatnyk v.\nKuriatnyk, 286 Ga. 589, 590 (690 SE2d 397) (2010). In her “Motion to Modify\nSentence,” Sullivan raises several challenges to the revocation of her probation.\nBecause the underlying subject matter of Sullivan’s appeal is the revocation of her\nprobation, she was required to file an application for discretionary appeal to obtain\nreview in this Court. See OCGA § 5-6-35 (a) (5), (b); Jones v. State, 322 Ga. App.\n269, 269, n. 2 (745 SE2d 1) (2013); Zamora v. State, 226 Ga. App. 105, 105 (485\nSE2d 214) (1997). Her failure to do so deprives us of jurisdiction over this appeal,\nwhich is hereby DISMISSED.\n\fCourt of...",
