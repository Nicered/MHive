Martin, Houston, for appellant.\nMac Smith, Dist. Atty., Weatherford, for State.\nBefore ASHWORTH, BURDOCK and HILL, JJ.\n\nOPINION\nHILL, Justice.\nMorris Hershell Lumpkin was convicted of murdering Louis Preston Cripps and his wife, Imogene Cripps, and was sentenced to two consecutive life sentences in the Texas Department of Corrections.\nHe appeals his conviction, arguing that: (1) there was insufficient evidence to support *887 the jury verdict; (2) his oral statement to a police officer should not have been admitted into evidence; (3) he should have been allowed to argue and charge the jury on the law of circumstantial evidence; (4) the prosecutor improperly implied that the defense did not \"go by the rules\"; and (5) the two life sentences should run concurrently, not consecutively.\nWe affirm the conviction.\nAppellant's first three grounds of error involve the sufficiency of the evidence.\nIn reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence in either a direct or circumstantial evidence case, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict and consider whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.
