Schroeder, Wheaton, for appellants.\nEmily R. Carrara, Maureen Sullivan Taylor, of Sullivan Taylor &amp; Gumina, Wheaton, for appellee.\n\n\n*651 OPINION\nJustice BURKE delivered the judgment of the court, with opinion:\nIn this case we are asked to revisit our decision in In re M.M.D., 213 Ill.2d 105, 289 Ill.Dec. 616, 820 N.E.2d 392 (2004), and again address whether Wickham v. Byrne, 199 Ill.2d 309, 263 Ill.Dec. 799, 769 N.E.2d 1 (2002), which held unconstitutional Illinois' grandparent visitation statute, invalidated a preexisting agreed order for grandparent visitation. However, because the minor who was the subject of the agreed visitation order at issue here has turned 18 during the pendency of this appeal, the case has been rendered moot. We vacate the judgments of the courts below and remand the cause with instructions to dismiss.\n\nBackground\nRalph and Deborah Hruby were married in 1977 and had three children: Greg, born November 25, 1983, Jeff, born August 4, 1985, and Katie, born July 22, 1989. Shortly after Katie's birth, in October of 1989, Deborah died of a cerebral hemorrhage.\nIn 1992, Ralph married Sondra. Sondra Hruby adopted Ralph's three children in November of 1993.\nGeraldine Felzak is the mother of Deborah Hruby. In the spring of 1994, Geraldine filed an amended petition for grandparent visit...",
