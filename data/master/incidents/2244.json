State\n**판결일**: 2019-01-10\n**법원**: Court of Appeals of Texas\n**관할**: Texas, TX\n\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n             In the\n        Court of Appeals\nSecond Appellate District of Texas\n         at Fort Worth\n     ___________________________\n\n          No. 02-18-00022-CR\n     ___________________________\n\n  JASON EUGENE ARNOLD, Appellant\n\n                    V.\n\n         THE STATE OF TEXAS\n\n\n  On Appeal from the 396th District Court\n         Tarrant County, Texas\n       Trial Court No. 1424463D\n\n\n   Before Gabriel, Kerr, and Birdwell, JJ.\n  Memorandum Opinion by Justice Gabriel\n\f                           MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n      Appellant Jason Eugene Arnold appeals from his conviction for the second-\n\ndegree felony offense of sexual assault for which he received a ten-year, probated\n\nsentence. See Tex. Penal Code Ann. § 22.011(a)(1). He argues that the trial court\n\nabused its discretion by limiting his cross-examination of the complainant, which he\n\nasserts violated his constitutional confrontation rights, and by excluding portions of\n\nhis custodial-interrogation video, which he contends violated his constitutional rights\n\nto due process and evidentiary rule 106. Arnold’s arguments regarding the cross-\n\nexamination limits either were not preserved or did not violate the confrontation\n\nclause. Arnold did not raise his constitutional arguments regarding the video in the\n\ntrial court, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion under the rules of evidence\n\nby excluding the redacted portions of the video. Accordingly, we affirm the trial\n\ncourt’s judgment.\n\n                   ...",
