The testimony of the alleged victim which was in many respects strongly supported by other evidence, was, if believed by the jury, sufficient to establish every element of the crime charged.\nOn the entire record we find reflected no reversible error and, therefore, judgment should be affirmed.\nSo ordered.\nBUFORD, C. J., BROWN, THOMAS and SEBRING, JJ., concur....",
