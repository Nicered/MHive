State\n**판결일**: 2021-06-21\n**법원**: Supreme Court of Georgia\n**관할**: Georgia, GA\n\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\nIn the Supreme Court of Georgia\n\n\n\n                                  Decided: June 21, 2021\n\n\n                S20G1295. WILSON v. THE STATE.\n\n\n     ELLINGTON, Justice.\n\n     In 2015, a Catoosa County jury found Timothy John Wilson,\n\nJr., guilty of child molestation, statutory rape, and two counts of\n\nincest involving his 13-year-old stepdaughter, B.

Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the Court of\n\nAppeals.\n\n     In 2009, Wilson married B. O.’s mother and, shortly thereafter,\n\nthe family moved to Catoosa County. In October 2014, when B.
