On appeal, defendant contends that his counsel was ineffective for failing to move to dismiss a portion of his indictment on the basis that it violated his speedy trial rights. In addition, defendant contends that he was denied his constitutional right to testify at trial.\nThe evidence adduced at trial demonstrated that, in March 2002, defendant sexually assaulted the victim, S.R., who was his fiancee's daughter. On June 11, 2002, the victim reported the incident and defendant was arrested. The following day, on June 12, 2002, defense counsel filed a demand for trial at defendant's initial court appearance. On July 3, 2002, the State charged defendant by information with criminal sexual assault, a Class 1 felony (720 ILCS 5/12-13(a)(1) (West 2002)).
