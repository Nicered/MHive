CR508, CR509\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\r\n\r\n\r\n\tBillie Warren Smith appeals the trial court's reduction of bail in two separate but\r\nrelated cases.  The appellate record before us is devoid of any details of the underlying\r\noffenses alleged.  Appellant was arrested under warrants issued by a Justice of the Peace for\r\nthe felony offenses of Aggravated Sexual Assault of a Child, and for Indecency with a Child. \r\nBail was set in the Aggravated Sexual Assault cause at $250,000, and in the Indecency cause\r\nat $200,000.  Appellant then filed with the trial court separate petitions for writ of habeas\r\ncorpus alleging the amounts set for his bail were unreasonable, and were a violation of Tex.\r\nConst. art. I, § 11 and Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 17.15 (Vernon 2005).   \r\n\r\n\tThe trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing on the merits of the petitions and\r\nultimately issued orders reducing the bail amounts to $125,000 and to $75,000, respectively. \r\nBecause the trial court ruled on the merits of appellant's petitions following an evidentiary\r\nhearing, we have jurisdiction over the appeals.  See Ex parte Hargett, 819 S.W.2d 866, 869\r\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1991).  ...",
