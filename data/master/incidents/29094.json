Crim. 364\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\nThe appellant is now confined in the county jail of Pittsburg county, Okla., pending an appeal to this court from a conviction for manslaughter rendered against her in the superior court of Pittsburg county. She now applies to be admitted to bail upon her own recognizance, upon the ground that she is a pauper and is unable to give any bond at all; that she is now a confirmed invalid, suffering from cancer of the uterus; that she is confined to her bed and in a critical condition, and is advised by her physicians that she can live but a short time; that while she is unable to give bond yet she has some friends who are willing to care for her.\nIn support of this motion the following certificates have been filed:\n\"After several examinations and observations of Myrtle Smith, who is now in the county jail, at McAlester, pending the action of the Criminal Court of Appeals in her case, I feel confident that she has a cancer of the uterus. Her condition is such *Page 365 \nthat humanity demands that she should be released. It is my opinion that she has only a short time to live. I feel that if she was released on her own recognizance that she could not get away if she tried, and I am certain that she would return if commanded to do so by the court. Yours truly, [Signed] W.C. Graves, M.D.\"\n\"I have been treating the above prisoner for the last two years, and I fully concur in the above certificate. Yours truly, [Signed] J.A. Smith, M.D., County Jail Physician.\"\n\"To the Criminal Court of...",
