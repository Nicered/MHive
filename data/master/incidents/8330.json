THOMPSEN, Appellee.\nNo. 04-CV-346.\nDistrict of Columbia Court of Appeals.\nArgued May 24, 2005.\nDecided July 14, 2005.\n*1219 Allen V. Farber, with whom James A. Barker, Jr., Washington, DC, was on the brief, for appellant.\nDale A. Cooter, Washington, DC, for appellee.\nBefore SCHWELB and GLICKMAN, Associate Judges, and BELSON, Senior Judge.\nSCHWELB, Associate Judge:\nA jury awarded Elaine J.S. Thompsen $100,000 on her claim of unjust enrichment against News World Communications, Inc. (the Times), a corporation which publishes a daily newspaper known as The Washington Times. The Times filed a timely post-trial motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law (JMOL) or, in the alternative, for a new trial, relying, inter alia, on a statute of limitations defense which it had asserted in pretrial motions and throughout the trial. On March 11, 2004, the trial judge denied the Times' post-trial motion. Judgment was entered on the verdict, and the Times appealed, again contending, inter alia, that Ms. Thompsen's claim was time-barred.\nTo decide this appeal, we must determine when the statute of limitations begins to run in a case of unjust enrichment. The issue is a novel and difficult one, and the parties have not provided us with, nor have we found, any applicable precedent in this jurisdiction. Although reasonable minds could differ as to the proper outcome, we follow the approach of courts in other jurisdiction...",
