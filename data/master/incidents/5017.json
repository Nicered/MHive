Gladstone.\n\nORDER\nThis case came before the Supreme Court in conference pursuant to Article I, Rule 12A(3)(b) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure. After reviewing the record and the parties' prebriefing statements, we proceed to decide the case at this time without further briefing or argument.\nThe defendant, Leon Stansell, was convicted by a jury on two counts of conspiracy to violate the Uniform Controlled Substances Act and was sentenced to concurrent terms of twenty years in prison, with ten years to serve, ten years suspended, and ten years probation.

The defendant now appeals from a Superior Court order denying his motion to reduce sentence, arguing that he could not be convicted of two counts of conspiracy when his alleged coconspirator had pled nolo contendere to only one count of conspiracy.\nPursuant to Rule 35 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, the defendant moved for a correction of his sentence on count 4  conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to distribute  arguing that he could not stand convicted of conspiracy because the codefendant, who cooperated with the police and testified against the defendant at trial, pled to a single count of conspiracy whereas the jury returned a verdict against the defendant of two counts...",
