We find that there was sufficient evidence to support Jones' convictions, and the trial court did not plainly err in excluding evidence at trial. We affirm.\nAn extended opinion would have no precedential value. We have, however. *271 provided the parties a memorandum setting forth the reasons for our decision. The judgment of the trial court is affirmed under Rule 30.25(b).\n...",
