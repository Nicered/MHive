WR-83,876-01\n\n\n                      EX PARTE ELTON WADE RODGERS, Applicant\n\n\n                  ON APPLICATION FOR A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS\n                  CAUSE NO. 11-00321 IN THE 235TH DISTRICT COURT\n                              FROM COOKE COUNTY\n\n\n        Per curiam.\n\n                                              ORDER\n\n        Pursuant to the provisions of Article 11.07 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, the\n\nclerk of the trial court transmitted to this Court this application for a writ of habeas corpus. Ex parte\n\nYoung, 418 S.W.2d 824, 826 (Tex. Crim. App. 1967). Applicant was convicted of indecency with\n\na child by contact and sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. He did not appeal his conviction.\n\n        Applicant contends, among other things, that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance\n\nbecause he misadvised Applicant about the meaning of his nolo contendere plea, leading him to\n\nbelieve there would still be an adversarial test of the evidence. The habeas record contains no record\n\nof admonishments, no judicial confession, no response from counsel, and no findings of fact.\n\n        Applicant has alleged facts that, if true, might entitle him to relief.
