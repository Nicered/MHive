  "description": "## 사건 정보\n\n**사건명**: David Gene LANCASTER v. Edward S. ALAMEIDA, Jr., Warden Attorney General of the State of California\n**판결일**: 2002-12-04\n**법원**: Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\n**관할**: USA, Federal\n\n## 인용\n\n- 51 F. App'x 765\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\nMEMORANDUM **\nDavid Gene Lancaster, a California state prisoner, appeals pro se the dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. § 2254 petition based on untimeliness. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2253. We review de novo, see Miles v. Prunty, 187 F.3d 1104, 1105 (9th Cir.1999), and we affirm.\nLancaster contends that his § 2254 petition was timely filed on November 8, 1998 because he is entitled to statutory and equitable tolling for the time during which his trial transcripts were lost. We are unpersuaded. Because Lancaster’s convictions became final prior to the enactment of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), Lancaster’s limitation period ended on April 24, 1997. See Patterson v. Stewart, 251 F.3d 1243, 1245 (9th Cir.2001).\nFirst, Lancaster argues that his requests to the court to retrieve his trial transcripts should toll the statute of limitations. Although the limitations period is generally tolled during the pendency of a properly filed application for state post-conviction relief, see 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2); Nino v. Galaza, 183 F.3d 1003, 1006 (9th Cir.1999), a motion to obtain transcripts is not an application for state post-conviction or other collateral review under § 2244(d)(2).\nSecond, Lancaster contends that the moment the prison lost his transcripts in 1995 marked a state-created impediment which entitles him to statutory tolling until the date he received them in 1998. See 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1)(B). We reject this argument because Lancaste...",
