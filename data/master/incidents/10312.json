AND SUBSIDIARIES, Petitioner v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, RespondentFPL Group, Inc. v. CommissionerNo. 5271-96United States Tax Court115 T.C. 554; 2000 U.S. Tax Ct. LEXIS 92; 115 T.C. No. 38; December 13, 2000, Filed *92  An appropriate order will be issued granting respondent's motion for partial summary judgment.  F, a regulated electric utility, is a wholly owned   subsidiary of P. F is required to follow prescribed regulatory   rules for regulatory accounting and financial reporting   purposes. In preparing its consolidated tax returns for the   years in issue, P characterized F's expenditures by using the   same characterization that F used for regulatory accounting and   financial reporting purposes. In an amended petition, P sought   to recharacterize as repair expenses, expenditures which it had   characterized as capital expenditures for tax purposes.     HELD: P's method of accounting for tax reporting purposes   was to characterize the expenditures in issue consistently with   the method that F used for regulatory accounting and financial   reporting purposes. By seeking to alter the method which it used   to characterize expenditures, P is attempting to change its   method of accounting. P has failed to obtain the consent of the   Secretary to change its method of accounting under sec. 446(e),   I.R.C. *93  ; therefore, P is not entitled to the claimed expense   deductions.
