Pen. Code Ann. § 22.01(a)(1), (b)(1) (West Supp. 2004-05). As called for in a plea bargain,\n\nthe court deferred adjudication and placed appellant on community supervision for six years.

In his only point of error, appellant contends that the\n\nHonorable Ken Anderson was disqualified from sitting in this cause because he had been the elected\n\ndistrict attorney when this cause arose, adjudication was deferred, and the motion to adjudicate was\n\nfiled.1 We will affirm the judgment.\n\n\n\n\n   1\n     This is an issue unrelated to the conviction.
