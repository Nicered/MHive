Young Yil Jo\n**판결일**: 1996-10-18\n**법원**: Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\n**관할**: USA, Federal\n\n## 인용\n\n- 99 F.3d 1147\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n99 F.3d 1147\n    NOTICE: Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3 provides that dispositions other than opinions or orders designated for publication are not precedential and should not be cited except when relevant under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, or collateral estoppel.UNITED STATES of America, Plaintiff-Appellee,v.Young Yil JO, Defendant-Appellant.\n    No. 95-10554.\n    United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit.\n    Argued and Submitted Oct. 7, 1996.Decided Oct. 18, 1996.\n    \n      Before:  WALLACE, HALL, and RYMER, Circuit Judges.\n    \n    \n      1\n      MEMORANDUM*\n    \n    \n      2\n      Young Yil Jo appeals from his conviction and sentence for conspiracy to distribute cocaine and methamphetamine.  We have jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291, and we affirm.\n    \n    \n      3\n      * Jo contends that the jury instructions omitted an essential element of the crime of conspiracy.  Unfortunately, the briefing and argument leave us in some doubt about what error Jo assigns to the instructions.  At times, Jo seems to argue that he could not be convicted unless he knew that the conspiracy's objectives were unlawful.  At other times, Jo seems to argue simply that knowledge of an (objectively) unlawful objective is an element of conspiracy.  We will treat each possibility in turn.\n    \n    \n      4\n      We review jury instructions as a whole to determine if they are misleading or inadequate to guide the jury's deliberations.
