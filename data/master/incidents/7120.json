App'x 268\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\nMEMORANDUM **\nLucila B. appeals from her guilty-plea conviction and 40-month sentence for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute a mixture or substance containing methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 846, 841(a)(1) &amp; (b)(1). Pursuant to Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), appellant’s counsel has filed a brief stating there are no grounds for relief, along with a motion to withdraw as counsel of record. We have provided the appellant the opportunity to file a pro se supplemental brief. No pro se supplemental brief or answering brief has been filed.\nBecause our independent review of the record pursuant to Penson v. Ohio, 488 U.S. 75, 82-83, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), indicates that appellant waived her right to appeal and was sentenced within the terms of the plea agreement, we enforce the waiver and dismiss the appeal. See United States v. Nguyen, 235 F.3d 1179, 1182 (9th Cir.2000).\nCounsel’s motion to withdraw is granted.\nDISMISSED.\n\n This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.\n\n...",
