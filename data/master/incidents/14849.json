  "description": "## 사건 정보\n\n**사건명**: Samuel RIVERA, a/k/a Tony El Enfermo v. The STATE of Florida\n**판결일**: 1988-06-21\n**법원**: District Court of Appeal of Florida\n**관할**: Florida, FL\n\n**판사**: Ferguson, Hubbart, Pearson\n\n## 변호인\n\nBennett H. Brummer, Public Defender, and Harold Mendelow and Leonard F. Baer, Sp. Asst. Public Defenders, for appellant., Robert A. Butterworth, Atty. Gen., and Mark S. Dunn, Asst. Atty. Gen., for appel-lee.\n\n## 인용\n\n- 526 So. 2d 1046\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\nPER CURIAM.\nThe defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and armed robbery and sentenced thereon to life imprisonment and a term of 134 years on the respective convictions. We affirm the convictions. See Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U.S. 298, 105 S.Ct. 1285, 84 L.Ed.2d 222 (1985). However, as the State concedes, the sentence of 134 years of imprisonment for armed robbery, which departs from the recommended guideline sentence, is not supported by valid reasons. Accordingly, this sentence is reversed with directions to impose a sentence on the armed robbery conviction within the range of the recommended guideline.\nAffirmed in part; reversed in part.\n...",
