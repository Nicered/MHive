  "description": "## 사건 정보\n\n**사건명**: The People of the State of New York v. Clifford Lee Mack\n**판결일**: 1977-11-14\n**법원**: Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York\n**관할**: New York, NY\n\n## 인용\n\n- 59 A.D.2d 1052\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\nJudgment unanimously modified in accordance with memorandum and, as modified, affirmed. Memorandum: As the District Attorney commendably acknowledged, Trial Term erred in denying defendant’s request for a charge that the jury could find defendant guilty of criminal trespass as a lesser included crime of burglary, third degree (People v Henderson, 41 NY2d 233; People v Long, 40 AD2d 984). Defendant’s conviction of burglary, third degree, therefore, must be reversed and a new trial granted on that count. Defendant’s confession of possession of the weapon was sufficiently corroborated (see People v Spillman, 309 NY 295; People v Lo Turco, 256 App Div 1098, affd 280 NY 844); and so the judgment is otherwise affirmed. (Appeal from judgment of Monroe Supreme Court— burglary, third degree.) Present—Simons, J. P., Hancock, Jr., Denman, Goldman and Witmer, JJ.\n...",
