State\n**판결일**: 2014-12-31\n**법원**: Court of Appeals of Texas\n**관할**: Texas, TX\n\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\nAFFIRMED; Opinion Filed December 30, 2014.\n\n\n\n\n                                        S   In The\n                               Court of Appeals\n                        Fifth District of Texas at Dallas\n                                     No. 05-13-01229-CR\n\n                            VICKY RENEE MILLER, Appellant\n                                         V.\n                             THE STATE OF TEXAS, Appellee\n\n                      On Appeal from the 366th Judicial District Court\n                                   Collin County, Texas\n                          Trial Court Cause No. 366-81422-2012\n\n                            MEMORANDUM OPINION\n                           Before Justices Bridges, Lang, and Evans\n                                   Opinion by Justice Evans\n       Appellant Vicky Miller appeals from the judgment adjudicating her guilty of attempted\n\nmurder. Appellant asserts three points of error: (1) the evidence was insufficient to support the\n\nconviction for attempted murder; (2) the trial court erred by including a definition of murder in\n\nthe charge which included a “knowing” mental state; and (3) the trial court erred in overruling\n\nappellant’s objection during the State’s closing argument after the State commented on\n\nappellant’s failure to testify. Finding no merit in appellant’s arguments, we affirm the trial\n\ncourt’s judgment.\n\n                                       I.
