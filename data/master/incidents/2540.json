Record No. 170586                               JUSTICE STEPHEN R. McCULLOUGH\n                                                              April 5, 2018\nCARROLL EDWARD GREGG, JR.\n\n\n                       FROM THE COURT OF APPEALS OF VIRGINIA\n\n\n       Carroll Edward Gregg was convicted of common law involuntary manslaughter as well\n\nas involuntary manslaughter under Code § 18.2-154. In a published opinion, the Court of\n\nAppeals of Virginia concluded that Gregg could not be sentenced for both offenses. See Gregg\n\nv. Commonwealth, 67 Va. App. 375, 796 S.E.2d 447 (2017). It reversed and remanded for a new\n\nsentencing proceeding, to be held after the Commonwealth elected which conviction it would\n\nseek to have sentence imposed on. The Commonwealth appeals from this judgment. For the\n\nreasons explained below, we will affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\n                                        BACKGROUND\n\n       The victim, Junior Montero Sanchez, was in the process of repossessing Gregg’s truck\n\nwhen Gregg shot and killed him. The autopsy report reflected that Sanchez sustained a single\n\ngunshot wound to the back, which fatally damaged Sanchez’s lung and heart. The shooting\n\noccurred around midnight on June 5 or 6, 2014. Gregg acknowledged shooting Sanchez, but\n\nstated it was an accident.\n\n       A grand jury indicted Gregg for first-degree murder...",
