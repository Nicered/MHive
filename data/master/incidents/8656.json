CALABRESE, JR., JUDGE.\n\n## 변호인\n\nWilliam D. Mason, Cuyahoga County Prosecutor, Anna M. Faraglia, Assistant County Prosecutor, Justice Center &#8212; 9 th  Floor, 1200 Ontario Street, Cleveland, OH 44113, for plaintiff-appellee.\n\nCharles Cook, pro se, Inmate No. A440-654, Marion Correctional Inst., P.O. Box 57, Marion, Ohio 43301-0057, for defendant-appellant.\n\n## 인용\n\n- 2004 Ohio 5961\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n                        JOURNAL ENTRY AND OPINION\n{&#182; 1} Charles Cook has filed an application for reopening pursuant to App.R. 26(B). Cook is attempting to reopen the appellate judgment that was rendered by this court in State v.Cook, Cuyahoga App. No. 82777, 2004-Ohio-365, which affirmed his conviction for the offenses of kidnapping and felonious assault. For the following reasons, we decline to reopen Cook's original appeal.\n  {&#182; 2} As mandated by App.R. 26(B)(2)(b), Cook must establish \"a showing of good cause for untimely filing if the application is filed more than ninety days after journalization of the appellate judgment\" which is subject to reopening. See, also,State v. Cooey, 73 Ohio St.3d 411, 1995-Ohio-328; State v.Reddick, 72 Ohio St.3d 88, 1995-Ohio-249, 647 N.E.2d 784. Herein, Cook is attempting to reopen the appellate judgment that was journalized on February 9, 2004. The application for reopening was not filed until June 16, 2004, more than ninety days after journalization of the appellate judgment which affirmed Cook's conviction for the offenses of kidnapping and felonious assault. Cook has failed to establish \"a showing of good cause\" for the untimely filing of his application for reopening. State v. Klein (Apr. 8, 1991), Cuyahoga App. No. 58389, reopening disallowed (Mar. 15, 1994), Motion No. 49260, affirmed (1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 1481; State v. Trammell (July 24, 1995), Cuyahoga App. No. 67834, reopening disallowed (Apr. 22, 1996), Motion No. 70...",
