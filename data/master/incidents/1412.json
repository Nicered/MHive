CR-19-0800-B, THE HONORABLE JACK H. ROBISON, JUDGE PRESIDING\n\n\n\n                            MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n\n               Appellant Bo Michael Dresner stands charged by indictment with multiple child\n\nsexual abuse offenses and numerous counts of possession with intent to promote child\n\npornography. See Tex. Penal Code §§ 21.02(a) (continuous sexual abuse of young child or\n\nchildren), 21.11(a)(1) (indecency with child by sexual contact), 22.021(a)(1)(B) (aggravated\n\nsexual assault of child), 43.26(a), (f) (possession with intent to promote child pornography). He\n\nseeks to appeal the trial court’s order denying his pretrial request for bond reduction.\n\n               In criminal cases, the standard for determining jurisdiction of an appellate court\n\n“is not whether the appeal is precluded by law, but whether the appeal is authorized by law.\n\nRagston v. State, 424 S.W.3d 49, 52 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014) (quoting Abbott v. State,\n\n271 S.W.3d 694, 696–97 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008)); Blanton v. State, 369 S.W.3d 894, 902 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2012); State ex rel. Lykos v. Fine, 330 S.W.3d 904, 915 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011)...",
