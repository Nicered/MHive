Long, of Decatur, and Wm. C. Rayburn, of Guntersville, for appellants.\n\nCharge 2 is a correct charge and should have been given. Black v. State,  5 Ala. App. 87 ,  59 So. 692 ; Terry v. State, 17 Ala. App. 527 ,  86 So. 127 ; Kennedy v. State,  140 Ala. 1 , 37 So. 90 ; Caldwell v. State,  160 Ala. 96 ,  49 So. 679 ; Davis v. State, 8 Ala. App. 147 ,  62 So. 1027 ; Salm v. State,  89 Ala. 56 , 8 So. 66 ; Gilmore v. State,  99 Ala. 154 ,  13 So. 536 ; McCoy v. State, 170 Ala. 10 ,  54 So. 42\n\n## 인용\n\n- 184 So. 206\n- 28 Ala.

The questions were plainly for the jury, and it was for them to say what weight should be given the testimony of the witnesses, who were examined ore tenus before them.\nThe homicide grew out of a mutual rencounter between W.
