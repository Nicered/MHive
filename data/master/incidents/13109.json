GOCKEN, Petitioner.\nNos. 28291-3-I; 31424-6-I.\nThe Court of Appeals of Washington, Division One.\nSeptember 13, 1993.\nJoshua Weinstein of Washington Appellate Defender Association, for appellant.\nNorm Maleng, Prosecuting Attorney, and John Belatti, Deputy, for respondent.\nAGID, J.\nVictor Gocken appeals his judgment and sentence on one count of first degree murder and eight counts of forgery. He argues that: (1) the warrantless searches of the victim's condominium, where Gocken also lived, were unlawful *269 because there was no valid exception to the warrant requirement; (2) the State's amendment of the information adding the forgery counts on the first day of trial deprived him of his constitutional right to be notified of the charges against him; (3) the trial court erred by admitting autopsy photographs; (4) the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of premeditation; and (5) the testimony of four witnesses was improper because the record does not reflect that they responded to the oath administered before each testified. Gocken has also filed pro se briefs, and his personal restraint petition has been consolidated with this appeal. We affirm the trial court's judgment and sentence and deny Gocken's petition.\n\nI\n\nFACTS\nOn June 16, 1990, Officer Martin Brunette of the Auburn Police Department arrived at 72-y...",
