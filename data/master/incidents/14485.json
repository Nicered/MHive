  "description": "## 사건 정보\n\n**사건명**: FASSE v. SEXTON\n**판결일**: 1989-09-25\n**법원**: Court of Appeals of Georgia\n**관할**: Georgia, GA\n\n**판사**: Carley\n\n## 변호인\n\nSusan Fasse, pro se., Davis, Kirsch & Wolfe, Timothy W. Wolfe, for appellees.\n\n## 인용\n\n- 193 Ga. App. 9\n- 387 S.E.2d 17\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\nCarley, Chief Judge.\nAppellee-defendant answered appellant-plaintiff’s complaint and asserted a counterclaim. Acting pursuant to OCGA §§ 9-11-37 (b) (2) (C) and 9-11-37 (d) (1), the trial court subsequently dismissed appellant’s complaint as a sanction for her repeated failure to attend scheduled depositions. Appellant has filed a direct appeal from the order dismissing her complaint.\nAppellees’ counterclaim remains pending. “ ‘An appeal from an order dismissing the plaintiff’s claim is premature when there is a counterclaim pending in the court below.’ [Cits.] . . . [T]he pendency of the counterclaim plus the absence of a determination by the trial judge that there was no just reason for delay and express direction for entry of judgment under CPA § 54 (b) [OCGA § 9-11-54 (b)] ([cits.]) prevented the order from being final and [directly] appealable. This, coupled with the appellant’s failure to follow the applicable procedure for review under [OCGA § 5-6-34 (b)] ([Cits.]), subjects the instant appeal to dismissal [as premature].” Cleveland v. Watkins, 159 Ga. App. 885 (285 SE2d 546) (1981).\n\nAppeal dismissed.\n\n\nMcMurray, P. J., and Beasley, J., concur.\n\n...",
