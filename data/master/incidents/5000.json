UNITED STATES of America, Respondent—Appellee\n**판결일**: 2011-10-18\n**법원**: Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\n**관할**: USA, Federal\n\n**판사**: Agee, Shedd, Wynn\n\n## 변호인\n\nRobert Lee Winfield, Jr., Appellant Pro Se.\n\n## 인용\n\n- 450 F. App'x 291\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\nDismissed by unpublished PER CURIAM opinion.\nUnpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit.\nPER CURIAM:\nRobert Lee Winfield, Jr., seeks to appeal the district court’s order construing his writ of error coram nobis as a successive 28 U.S.C.A. § 2255 (West Supp.2011) motion and dismissing it on that basis. The order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of ap-pealability. 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(1)(B) (2006). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent “a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.” 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2) (2006). When the district court denies relief on the merits,. a *292prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that the district court’s assessment of the constitutional claims is debatable or wrong. Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); see Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). When the district court denies relief on procedural grounds, the prisoner must demonstrate both that the dispositive procedural ruling is debatable, and that the motion states a debatable claim of the denial of a constitutional right. Slack, 529 U.S. at 484-85, 120 S.Ct. 1595. We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Winfield has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument ...",
