Although we believe that the court acted precipitantly, we affirm the order of\ndismissal on the basis that the petition fails to establish a claim for habeas corpus relief.\n\n                Tenn. R. App. P. 3; Judgment of the Circuit Court is Affirmed.\n\nJAMES CURWOOD WITT , JR., J., delivered the opinion of the court, in which THOMAS T. WOODALL\nand ROBERT W.
