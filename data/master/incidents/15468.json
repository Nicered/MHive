  "description": "## 사건 정보\n\n**사건명**: The People of the State of New York v. Dwayne Sutton\n**판결일**: 1986-08-15\n**법원**: Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York\n**관할**: New York, NY\n\n## 인용\n\n- 122 A.D.2d 896\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\n— Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Kings County (Murray, J.), rendered July 13, 1984, convicting him of murder in the second degree (two counts), upon a jury verdict, and imposing sentence.\nJudgment reversed, on the law, and new trial ordered.\nAt the trial, the defendant testified that he was never advised of his Miranda rights, that he was hit and punched by detectives, that his request to call home was refused, and that after threats, he signed a written inculpatory statement without reading it and gave a videotaped statement to an Assistant District Attorney.\nThe trial court’s refusal to instruct the jury, as requested, on the issue of the voluntariness of the defendant’s and his codefendant’s statements, as required by CPL 710.70 (3), necessitates a new trial (see, People v Graham 55 NY2d 144; People v Gibson, 89 AD2d 859). The contents of these statements were important in order for the People to prove that the defendant possessed the requisite intent to commit the crimes *897with which he was charged. Hence, the error cannot be deemed harmless. Moreover, the statute is mandatory. It is derived from the principle that a defendant has an independent right to seek to convince the jury that a statement was involuntarily obtained, even if the hearing court has previously ruled that the statement is admissible as a matter of law (see, Crane v Kentucky, 476 US —, 106 S Ct 2142; Jackson v Denno, 378 US 368; People v Gibson, supra; 1 CJI [NY] PL 11....",
