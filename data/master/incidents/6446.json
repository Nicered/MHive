  "description": "## 사건 정보\n\n**사건명**: The People of the State of New York v. Zarhiah Richey\n**판결일**: 2009-02-17\n**법원**: Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York\n**관할**: New York, NY\n\n## 인용\n\n- 59 A.D.3d 641\n- 872 N.Y.S.2d 675\n- 873 N.Y.S.2d 348\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\nAppeal by the defendant from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Kings County (Tomei, J.), rendered March 1, 2007, convicting her of assault in the third degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree (two counts), after a nonjury trial, and imposing sentence.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.\nIn fulfilling our responsibility to conduct an independent review of the weight of the evidence (see CPL 470.15 [5]; People v Danielson, 9 NY3d 342 [2007]), we nevertheless accord great deference to the factfinder’s opportunity to view the witnesses, hear the testimony, and observe demeanor (see People v Mateo, 2 NY3d 383, 410 [2004], cert denied 542 US 946 [2004]; People v Bleakley, 69 NY2d 490, 495 [1987]). Upon reviewing the record here, we are satisfied that the verdict of guilt was not against the weight of the evidence (see People v Romero, 7 NY3d 633 [2006]). Florio, J.E, Covello, Balkin and Leventhal, JJ., concur.\n...",
