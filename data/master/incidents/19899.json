Appellants rely for patentability principally upon the provision of an absorber layer around the detecting element, the layer having a plurality of holes so that some slow neutrons can pass through the layer.\n    \n    \n      3\n      The claims stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. &#167; 103 as obvious over Klick2 and Weinberg.3 Weinberg discloses a tissue-equivalent neutron dosimeter having a compensating shield which contains an absorber layer.
