Hestand, with two counts of criminal sexual assault and two counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse.  In July 2003, a jury found defendant guilty on three counts.  In August 2003, the trial court imposed a 15-year prison sentence on the criminal- sexual-assault conviction and concurrent 7-year terms on the aggravated-criminal-sexual-abuse convictions.\n\nOn appeal, defendant argues (1) his aggravated-criminal-sexual-abuse conviction for fondling the victim's vagina must be vacated pursuant to the one-act, one-crime rule, (2) he was denied a fair trial when a witness read defendant's statement to police to the jury, and (3) the trial court improperly considered multiple victim-impact statements and imposed an excessive sentence.  We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand with directions.\n\nI.
