The District,\n\nLanier, Quintana, and Roque (the “District defendants”) have\n\nmoved to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6)\n\nfor failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n\nBecause Trimble fails to allege sufficiently that the District\n\nharmed her or her decedents as a result of a custom or policy,\n\nthe District defendants’ motion to dismiss will be granted with\n\nrespect to Trimble’s § 1983 claim.
