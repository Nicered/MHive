WR-82,658-01\n\n\n                     EX PARTE DAHN SEARCY CLARY, JR. , Applicant\n\n\n                 ON APPLICATION FOR A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS\n                CAUSE NO. 97F0133-005-A IN THE 5TH DISTRICT COURT\n                              FROM BOWIE COUNTY\n\n\n        Per curiam.\n\n                                              ORDER\n\n        Pursuant to the provisions of Article 11.07 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, the\n\nclerk of the trial court transmitted to this Court this application for a writ of habeas corpus. Ex parte\n\nYoung, 418 S.W.2d 824, 826 (Tex. Crim. App. 1967).

The trial court\n\f                                                                                                       2\n\nshall therefore conduct another live evidentiary hearing on the matter at which, at a minimum...",
