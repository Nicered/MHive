  "description": "## 사건 정보\n\n**사건명**: The State of Washington v. James Gary Blunt\n**판결일**: 2003-05-13\n**법원**: Court of Appeals of Washington\n**관할**: Washington, WA\n\n**판사**: Hunt\n\n## 변호인\n\nJames G. Blunt, pro se., Manek R. Mistry (of Backlund & Mistry), for appellant., Jeremy R. Randolph, Prosecuting Attorney, and J. Andrew Toynbee, Deputy, for respondent.\n\n## 인용\n\n- 118 Wash. App. 1\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\nHunt, C.J.\nJames G. Blunt appeals his sentence for vehicular homicide, claiming insufficient evidence of his prior offenses and improper reference to his silence about these prior offenses. Finding no error, we affirm.\nFACTS\nBlunt, who had a blood alcohol level of 0.12, hit and killed a bicyclist with his pickup truck. The State charged Blunt with vehicular homicide, hit and run (resulting in death), and driving while license suspended (DWLS). Clerk’s Papers (CP) at 30-32. Blunt had a long history of serious traffic offenses, including multiple convictions for DWLS and driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI).\nI. Plea Agreement\nBlunt agreed to plead guilty to the vehicular homicide charge, and the prosecutor agreed to recommend dismissing the other charges and sentencing Blunt “within [the] standard range as determined by [the] court.” CP at 37. The written agreement also included that the “total standard range is not agreed,” that “criminal history is not agreed,” that Blunt is “demanding State prove any prior convictions,” CP at 36, and that “Defense requires State to prove all relevant prior convictions.” CP at 41.\n*4Prior to entry of Blunt’s plea, both parties reconfirmed their understanding that the State would prove each of the prior DUI convictions at sentencing. Reiterating that Blunt’s prior offenses were “disputed,” the trial court accepted Blunt’s vehicular homicide guilty plea and dismissed the other charges. Report of Proceedings (RP) (July 3, 2001) at 7-9.\n...",
