Dept. of Rev.\n**판결일**: 1998-11-27\n**법원**: Oregon Supreme Court\n**관할**: Oregon, OR\n\n**판사**: Carson, Chief Justice, and Gillette, Van Hoomissen, Durham, Leeson, and Riggs, Justices\n\n## 인용\n\n- 969 P.2d 380\n- 328 Or. 15\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\n969 P.2d 380 (1998)\n328 Or. 15\nLyle McBROOM, Appellant,\nv.\nDEPARTMENT OF REVENUE, STATE OF OREGON, Respondent.\nOTC 4075; SC S44722.\nSupreme Court of Oregon.\nArgued and Submitted November 10, 1998.\nDecided November 27, 1998.\nLyle McBroom, appellant pro se, waived argument and filed the briefs.\nJerry Bronner, Assistant Attorney General, Salem, argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief was Hardy Myers, Attorney General.\nBefore CARSON, Chief Justice, and GILLETTE, VAN HOOMISSEN, DURHAM, LEESON, and RIGGS, Justices.[**]\n*381 PER CURIAM.\nTaxpayer appeals from a judgment of the Oregon Tax Court that affirmed the Department of Revenue's assessment of personal income tax against taxpayer for the 1991 tax year. Taxpayer contends that the gain that he realized upon the exercise of a stock option given to him by his employer was not taxable in Oregon, because he no longer was an Oregon resident at the time he exercised the option.\nThis court has considered each of taxpayer's supporting legal arguments and concludes that none is well taken. An explanation of our reasons for affirming the Tax Court's decision unlikely would benefit the bench, bar, or public.\nThe judgment of the Tax Court is affirmed.\nNOTES\n[**]  Kulongoski, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n...",
