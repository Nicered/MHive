  "description": "## 사건 정보\n\n**사건명**: Canard X. HERNDON v. STATE of Florida\n**판결일**: 1996-02-06\n**법원**: District Court of Appeal of Florida\n**관할**: Florida, FL\n\n**판사**: Booth, Nortwick, Wolf\n\n## 변호인\n\nCanard X. Herndon, pro se, for Appellant,, No appearance, for Appellee.\n\n## 인용\n\n- 667 So. 2d 489\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\nPER CURIAM.\nWe affirm the order denying relief sought under Florida Rules of Criminal Procedure 3.800(a). We note, however, that the plea of guilty/negotiated sentence form and the sentencing seoresheet both designate appellant’s offense as aggravated assault on a law enforcement officer, while the judgment of conviction and order denying Rule 3.800(a) relief designate the offense as attempted first degree murder of a law enforcement officer, a life felony. Accordingly, we remand this cause for the limited purpose of the entry of a corrected judgment which accurately reflects the offense to which appellant pled guilty.\nBOOTH, WOLF and VAN NORTWICK, JJ., concur.\n...",
