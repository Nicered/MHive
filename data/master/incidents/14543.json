  "description": "## 사건 정보\n\n**사건명**: Bryant v. State\n**판결일**: 1989-07-13\n**법원**: District Court of Appeal of Florida\n**관할**: Florida, FL\n\n**판사**: Cobb\n\n## 인용\n\n- 546 So. 2d 762\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\n546 So. 2d 762 (1989)\nDaniel Josiah BRYANT, Appellant,\nv.\nSTATE of Florida, Appellee.\nNo. 88-1300.\nDistrict Court of Appeal of Florida, Fifth District.\nJuly 13, 1989.\n*763 James B. Gibson, Public Defender, and Nancye R. Crouch, Asst. Public Defender, Daytona Beach, for appellant.\nRobert A. Butterworth, Atty. Gen., Tallahassee, and Laura Griffin, Asst. Atty. Gen., Daytona Beach, for appellee.\nCOBB, Judge.\nDaniel J. Bryant urges that the trial court erred in enhancing his convictions for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon (a firearm) from third degree to second degree felonies pursuant to section 775.087(1), Florida Statutes (1987). The state concedes error based upon Perez v. State, 431 So. 2d 274 (Fla. 5th DCA 1983), approved, 449 So. 2d 818 (Fla. 1984) and other cases.\nThe appellant also asserts that court costs of $225.00 were imposed upon him without notice and an opportunity to be heard contrary to Harriel v. State, 520 So. 2d 271 (Fla. 1988) and Mays v. State, 519 So. 2d 618 (Fla. 1988). Irrespective of whether costs are assessed under sections 960.20, 943.25, 27.56, or 27.3455, Florida Statutes (1987), the court must provide adequate notice of such assessment to the defendant with a full opportunity to be heard and to object. Jenkins v. State, 444 So. 2d 947, 950 (Fla. 1984). Not being afforded this procedural due process is fundamental error and, as a result, no contemporaneous objection is needed to preserve the issue for appellate review. Henriquez v. State, 54...",
