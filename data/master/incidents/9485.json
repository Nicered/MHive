Beasley, Jr., Judge\n\n\n\n                    No. W2002-00748-CCA-R3-CD - Filed December 17, 2002\n\n\nThe defendant, Richard Bokanper,1 appeals his Shelby County Criminal Court jury convictions of\nburglary and theft. Following the guilty verdicts, the trial court sentenced the defendant as a career\noffender to an effective term of twelve years in the Department of Correction. On appeal, the\ndefendant challenges only the sufficiency of the convicting evidence. Because the evidence\ninsufficiently corroborates the inculpative testimony of an accomplice, we reverse the convictions\nand dismiss the charges.\n\n       Tenn. R.
