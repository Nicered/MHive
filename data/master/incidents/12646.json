  "description": "## 사건 정보\n\n**사건명**: Robert William CLAYTON v. STATE of Oklahoma\n**판결일**: 1995-01-10\n**법원**: Court of Criminal Appeals of Oklahoma\n**관할**: Oklahoma, OK\n\n**판사**: Chapel, Johnson, Lane, Lumpkin, Strubhar\n\n## 인용\n\n- 892 P.2d 646\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\nSTRUBHAR, Judge:\nRobert William Clayton, Petitioner, was convicted of Murder in the First Degree and sentenced to death in the District Court of Tulsa County, Case No. CRF-85-2501.

State, 876 P.2d 682 (Okl.Cr.1993). This request is presented again in Proposition VI of Petitioner’s Brief. This Court has held Mitchell to be prospective in effect. Nguyen v. State, 879 P.2d 148 (1994); Smith v. State, 878 P.2d 375 (1994). Because Petitioner’s appeal was final before Mitchell was handed down his argument is moot and will not be addressed.\nIn addressing Petitioner’s briefed propositions of error we initially reiterate that an application for post conviction relief in a capital case is not a new trial or a second appeal. Smith v. State, 826 P.2d 615, 616 (Okl.Cr.1992), cert...",
