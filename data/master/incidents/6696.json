State\n**판결일**: 2008-08-20\n**법원**: Court of Appeals of Texas\n**관할**: Texas, TX\n\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn The\r\nCourt of Appeals\r\nFor The\r\nFirst District of Texas\r\n____________\r\n\r\nNO. 01-07-00564-CR\r\n____________\r\n\r\nVICTOR ORALDO PENA MORUA, Appellant\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF TEXAS, Appellee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Appeal from the 230th District Court \r\nHarris County, Texas\r\nTrial Court Cause No. 1090788\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nMEMORANDUM  OPINION\r\n          We lack jurisdiction to hear this appeal.

Further, I waive my\r\nright of appeal which I may have should the court accept the foregoing plea bargain\r\nagreement between myself and the prosecutor.”   \r\n\r\n          After considering the presentence report and evidence admitted at the\r\npresentence investigation hearing, the trial court sentenced appellant on May 22, 2007\r\nto eight years in prison, a punishment that fell within the agreed cap of 10 years. \r\n\r\n          We note that on March 23, 2007, the date appellant pleaded guilty, the trial\r\ncourt entered a certification of right of appeal that states: “I, judge of the trial court\r\ncertify that this criminal case is not a plea-bar...",
