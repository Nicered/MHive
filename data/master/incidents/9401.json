  "description": "## 사건 정보\n\n**사건명**: Eric PIERRE v. The STATE of Florida\n**판결일**: 2003-03-12\n**법원**: District Court of Appeal of Florida\n**관할**: Florida, FL\n\n**판사**: Cope, Fletcher, Goderich\n\n## 변호인\n\nJ.C. Elso and Andrew M. Teschner, Coral Gables, for appellant., Charles J. Crist, Jr., Attorney General, and Andrea D. England, Assistant Attorney General, for appellee.\n\n## 인용\n\n- 844 So. 2d 658\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\nPER CURIAM.\nEric Pierre appeals his convictions for armed robbery and armed sexual battery.\nWe conclude that the trial court’s denial of the defendant-appellant’s motion to suppress evidence is supported by the record. “[A] trial court’s ruling on the voluntariness of a confession will not be overturned unless clearly erroneous.” Chambers v. State, 742 So.2d 466, 468 (Fla. 3d DCA 1999).\nRegarding closing arguments, we conclude that the trial court’s rulings were within its discretion. “[T]he trial court’s ruling on these matters will not be overturned unless a clear abuse of discretion is shown.” Hooper v. State, 476 So.2d 1253, 1257 (Fla.1985) (citations omitted).\nAffirmed.\n...",
