The firearm enhancement did not violate\n\ndouble jeopardy because the legislature clearly intended to impose multiple\n\npunishments for the same conduct in his case. He is otherwise precluded from\n\nappealing his sentence because the trial court properly exercised its discretion to\n\nfind a sentence within the standard range appropriate. We affirm.\n\n                                     FACTS\n\n      Kevin Barber's son Chad Barber owned two chainsaws that were stolen\n\nfrom Barber's residence on May 19, 2016. Chadl later found chainsaws for sale\n\nonline that both he and Barber believed were the stolen chainsaws. They believed\n\nthey could identify the chainsaws because they had been modified in a fairly\n\nunique way.\n\n\n\n\n      1 We refer to Chad Barber throughout this opinion as \"Chad\" to avoid\nconfusing father and son. We mean no disrespect.\n\fNo. 78776-4-1/2\n\n\n       Posing as potential purchasers, the two made arrangements to meet the\n\nonline seller at a p...",
