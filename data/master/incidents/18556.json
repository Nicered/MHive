BUTLER, Defendant-Appellant.\nNo. 74-188.\nIllinois Appellate Court  Second District (1st Division).\nJuly 30, 1975.\nRehearing denied September 12, 1975.\nFrank Wesolowski, Jr., Public Defender, of Wheaton (Robert H. Heise, Assistant Public Defender, of counsel), for appellant.\nJohn J. Bowman, State's Attorney, of Wheaton (James F. Campion, Assistant State's Attorney, of counsel), for the People.\nReversed and remanded.\nMr. PRESIDING JUSTICE SEIDENFELD delivered the opinion of the court:\nDefendant appeals from his conviction of armed robbery after a jury trial and from his sentence of 4-12 years' imprisonment. He contends that detailed evidence of another crime (for which he had previously been tried and acquitted) heard in the present case over his objection prevented a fair trial; and that he was not proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Alternatively he urges that the sentence is excessive. The issue of trial prejudice arises from unusual circumstances. Defendant was convicted of an armed robbery alleged to have taken place on November 14, 1972, at the Parkview Pizza location on Maple Avenue *79 in Downers Grove, where one Richard Smeeth was the acting manager. In a previous trial of Butler, the same Richard Smeeth had testified that defendant was the armed robber who had held him up on November 2, 1972, at the Parkview Pizza location on Main Street in Downers Grove...",
