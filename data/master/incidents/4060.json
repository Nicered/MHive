PD-0646-13\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIRVING MAGANA GARCIA, Appellant\r\n\r\nv.\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF TEXAS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON APPELLANT’S PETITION FOR DISCRETIONARY REVIEW\r\nFROM THE THIRTEENTH COURT OF APPEALS\r\nHIDALGO COUNTY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            Alcala, J., filed a dissenting opinion in which Johnson and Cochran, JJ.,\r\njoined.\r\n \r\nDISSENTING OPINION\r\n\r\n           The trial-court judge’s single question asking whether Irving Magana Garcia,\r\nappellant, wanted a language interpreter was wholly inadequate to establish that he\r\nvoluntarily waived his federal constitutional right to an interpreter whose assistance would\r\nhave enabled him to understand the proceedings and confront the witnesses against him.  See\r\nU.S. Const. amends. VI, XIV.  Although I concur with the majority opinion that, in an\r\nappropriate case, a record may be sufficient to show a knowing and voluntary waiver despite\r\nthe absence of a transcript of the actual statements at the time they transpired, I disagree that\r\nthe record in this case adequately establishes that appellant’s waiver of his right to an\r\ninterpreter was voluntary.  Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals\r\nupholding appellant’s conviction for second-degree murder and remand to the court of\r\nappeals for a harm analysis.   See Garcia v. State, No. 13-11-00547-CR, 2013 Tex. App.\r\nLEXIS 2328, 2013 WL 865411, at *2 (Tex. App.—Corpus Chr...",
