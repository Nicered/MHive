State\n**판결일**: 2001-06-28\n**법원**: Court of Appeals of Texas\n**관할**: Texas, TX\n\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNUMBERS 13-00-721-CR &amp; 13-00-722-CR\r\n\r\nCOURT OF APPEALS\r\n\r\nTHIRTEENTH DISTRICT OF TEXAS\r\n\r\nCORPUS CHRISTI\r\n\r\n____________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nWILLIAM DAVID MICK,       Appellant,\r\n\r\n\r\nv.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF TEXAS,       Appellee.\r\n\r\n____________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nOn appeal from the 36th District Court of San Patricio County, Texas.\r\n\r\n____________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nO P I N I O N\r\n\r\nBefore Chief Justice Valdez and Justices Yañez and Castillo\r\n\r\nOpinion by Justice Yañez\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant pleaded nolo contendere to charges in two separate indictments: 1) aggravated sexual assault and indecency with\r\na child; and 2) indecency with a child.   In each case, the trial court assessed punishment at twelve years in the Institutional\r\nDivision of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, with the sentences to run concurrently.  Because appellant confessed\r\nto the offenses in both cases (1) with the same confession, we address both cases with this one opinion.  \r\n\r\nAppellant's court-appointed attorney has filed a brief in which he has concluded that this appeal is wholly frivolous and\r\nwithout merit.  See Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738, 744-45, 87 S. Ct. 1396 (1967).  The brief meets the requirements of\r\nAnders as it presents a professional evaluation of why there are no arguable grounds for advancing an appeal.  See Stafford\r\nv. State, 813 S.W.2...",
