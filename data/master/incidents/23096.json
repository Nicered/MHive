Bice, Judge: The primary issue for our consideration is whether petitioner made a taxable gift by the assignment to his wife of a one-half interest in his literary work, “Drums of Fu Manchu.” Although we have already held in a previous opinion, Sax Rohmer, 14 T.

Petitioner contends that this assignment was made as consideration for various professional and other services rendered by his wife in the writing of this novel, and that a gift resulted only to the extent that the value of the interest transferred exceeded the value of such services. However, we are unable to find, on the basis of this record, that these services were, in fact, given as consideration for the assignment of an interest in the novel rather than being in the nature of gratuitous services a wife will render in the aid of her husband’s professional and business pursuits, whenever she may be of help.
