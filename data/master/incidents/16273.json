  "description": "## 사건 정보\n\n**사건명**: Theodore MENUT v. STATE of Florida\n**판결일**: 1984-03-14\n**법원**: District Court of Appeal of Florida\n**관할**: Florida, FL\n\n**판사**: Anstead, Downey, Hersey\n\n## 변호인\n\nRichard L. Jorandby, Public Defender, and Anthony Calvello, Asst. Public Defender, West Palm Beach, for appellant., Jim Smith, Atty. Gen., Tallahassee, and Marlyn J. Altman, Asst. Atty. Gen., West Palm Beach, for appellee.\n\n## 인용\n\n- 446 So. 2d 718\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\nHERSEY, Judge.\nTheodore Menut, convicted of murder, appealed and while that appeal was pending here he was twice called to testify in trials against one Christopher Clugston. On each occasion he invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege, was granted immunity, refused to testify and was held in contempt. The two judgments of contempt are the subject of this consolidated appeal.\nAppellant argues first that the immunity defined in Section 914.04, Florida Statutes (Supp.1982), is not coextensive with the scope of the Fifth Amendment because it does not provide derivative use immunity. “[Ijmmunity from use and derivative use is coextensive with the scope of the privilege against self-incrimination and therefore is sufficient to compel testimony over a claim of the privilege.” Kastigar v. United States, 406 U.S. 441, 453, 92 S.Ct. 1653, 1661, 32 L.Ed.2d 212, 222 (1972). The Florida Statute provides both use and derivative use immunity. State v. Harrison, 442 So.2d 389 (Fla. 4th DCA, 1983); Novo v. Scott, 438 So.2d 477 (Fla. 3d DCA 1983); State v. McSwain, 440 So.2d 502 (Fla. 2d DCA, 1983).\nNext, appellant maintains that he could not be compelled to testify because he would not be immune from prosecution for perjury. It is true that a grant of immunity is not a license to perjure oneself. It is equally true, however, that a statement given under a grant of immunity may not itself be used to convict for perjury by inconsistent or contradictory statements. McDonald v. State, 321 So.2d 45...",
