  "description": "## 사건 정보\n\n**사건명**: Robert Wilson v. William W. Sibley\n**판결일**: 1877-10-15\n**법원**: Mississippi Supreme Court\n**관할**: Mississippi, MS\n\n**판사**: Campbell\n\n## 변호인\n\nIt. Bowman and Frank Johnston, for the appellant., Grarnett Andrews, for the appellees., J. 0. Prewett, on the same side.\n\n## 인용\n\n- 54 Miss. 656\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\nCampbell, J.,\ndelivered the opinion of the court.\nThe claim of the appellees was barred by the Statute of Limitations of six years at the time of filing their bill. There was no fraudulent concealment of the cause of action from the knowledge of the appellees by the maker of the note; and the proposition that he is a trustee, and not protected by the Statute of Limitations, is not maintainable. The note made him merely a debtor. That the note is not barred as to a personal representative of the payee, who may sue within one year after the date of his letters of administration (Code of 1857, p. 401, art. 18; Code of 1871, § 2162), does not avail the appellees to avoid the bar of the statute. It is alone by virtue of that statute that the note is not barred as to all the world. That statute creates a most dangerous exception, and must be confined strictly to the state of case for which it provides.\n\nDecree reversed and hill dismissed.\n\n...",
