Petrazzuoli Brothers, Inc.\n**판결일**: 1987-02-24\n**법원**: Connecticut Appellate Court\n**관할**: Connecticut, CT\n\n**판사**: Borden\n\n## 변호인\n\nJohn J.

We find no error on the appeal. We find error on the cross appeal.\nThe jury could reasonably have found the following facts. James H. Butts, Jr., the plaintiffs son, purchased a 1975 Volvo automobile in 1977 for $3800 after securing a credit union loan. In 1978 or 1979, Butts joined the Navy and gave the car to the plaintiff, his mother. The registration and certificate of title, however, remained in Butts’ name. The plaintiff paid off $3000 of the $3800 c...",
