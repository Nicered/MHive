Therefore, on this appeal, we are\nconstrained to hold that the sentencing court acted within its\ndiscretion -- derived from that remittal -- when it modified\ndefendant's sentence in accordance with the Appellate Division's\ndirective.    We further conclude that the sentencing court's\nimposition of consecutive sentences for defendant's convictions\nof first-degree assault and first-degree robbery comports with\nPenal Law § 70.25 (2).    We, therefore, affirm.\n   ...",
