State\n**판결일**: 1932-01-20\n**법원**: Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas\n**관할**: Texas, TX\n\n**판사**: Lattimore, Morrow\n\n## 변호인\n\nMyers Pressly, of Fort Worth, for appellant., Lloyd W.

Reference to the calendar shows that the convening date for said term of court thus fixed, would have been April 20, 1931, if said law had been then effective. However the bill containing the enactment was not approved by the Governor of Texas until April 27, 1931. The record before us shows that the trial term of the district court of Hood county, Texas, the county in which this trial was had, in fact convened on April 27, 1931, same being the date proper for its convening under the law as it was prior to the adoption of said chapter 331.
