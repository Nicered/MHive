  "description": "## 사건 정보\n\n**사건명**: The People of the State of New York v. Brian Donovan\n**판결일**: 2000-04-03\n**법원**: Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York\n**관할**: New York, NY\n\n## 인용\n\n- 271 A.D.2d 453\n- 706 N.Y.S.2d 896\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\n—Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Nassau County (Galasso, J.), rendered April 30, 1998, convicting him of assault in the second degree and aggravated criminal contempt, upon a jury verdict, and imposing sentence.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution (see, People v Contes, 60 NY2d 620), we find that it is legally sufficient to establish the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Specifically, the evidence established that the defendant, in violation of a duly-served order of protection, of which the defendant concededly had actual knowledge, recklessly caused physical injury to the complainant, for whose protection the order was issued (see, Penal Law § 215.52). The evidence was also sufficient to establish the defendant’s guilt of assault in the second degree (see, Penal Law § 120.05 [6]). Moreover, upon the exercise of our factual review power, we find that the verdict was not against the weight of the evidence (see, CPL 470.15 [5]).\nThe defendant’s sentence was not excessive (see, People v Suitte, 90 AD2d 80).\nThe defendant’s remaining contentions are without merit. Friedmann, J. P., McGinity, Luciano and Feuerstein, JJ., concur.\n...",
