Snook contends that in ordering him to make restitution under the Victim and Witness Protection Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3663-64, the district court erred by failing to consider his ability to repay $3,307,491.69.   We decline to consider this contention because Snook stipulated to a higher restitution amount in his plea agreement and did not object at sentencing.  See United States v. DeSalvo, 41 F.3d 505, 511 (9th Cir.1994) (generally, restitution issue not raised before district court will not be addressed on appeal).\n    \n    \n      3\n      AFFIRMED.\n    \n    \n      \n        *\n         The panel unanimously finds this case suitable for decision without oral argument.
