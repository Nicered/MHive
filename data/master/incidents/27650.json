  "description": "## 사건 정보\n\n**사건명**: M.L. Leard v. State.\n**판결일**: 1925-02-21\n**법원**: Court of Criminal Appeals of Oklahoma\n**관할**: Oklahoma, OK\n\n**판사**: Bessey, Doyle, Edwards\n\n## 변호인\n\nCrump, White & Seawel, for plaintiff in error,., George F. Short, Atty. Gen., and G. B. Fulton, Asst-Atty. Gen., for the State.\n\n## 인용\n\n- 285 P. 243\n- 30 Okla. Crim. 191\n- 235 P. 243\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\nThe plaintiff in error assigns several errors as reasons for reversing this case: First, that the court erred in overruling plaintiff in error's application for a change of venue; second, that the court erred in overruling plaintiff in error's challenge for cause to certain jurors; third, that the court erred in excluding competent evidence offered on the part of plaintiff in error; fourth, that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the verdict. *Page 193 \nOn the application for change of venue, the plaintiff in error filed an affidavit, with four supporting affidavits, to the effect that the minds of the inhabitants of Okfuskee county were so prejudiced against him that he could not obtain a fair trial therein. In addition the sheriff of Okfuskee county testified that there had been talk of mob violence. The county attorney made a counter showing. We have examined carefully the record on this point, and adhere to the rule, heretofore adopted by this court, that the granting or refusing of a change of venue is within the sound discretion of the trial court, and a case will not be reversed unless there is abuse of such discretion. We believe that there is no such showing of the inability of plaintiff in error to get a fair trial in Okfuskee county as would constitute an abuse of discretion. Starr v. State,5 Okla.
