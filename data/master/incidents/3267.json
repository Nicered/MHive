  "description": "## 사건 정보\n\n**사건명**: Harris, Roderick\n**판결일**: 2016-05-25\n**법원**: Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas\n**관할**: Texas, TX\n\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n             IN THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS\n                         OF TEXAS\n                                      NO. WR-80,923-02\n\n                           In re RODERICK HARRIS, Relator\n\n       ON MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE EMERGENCY APPLICATION\n            FOR WRIT OF PROHIBITION AND EMERGENCY\n              APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF PROHIBITION;\n                REQUEST FOR INJUNCTION IN CAUSE\n              NO. W09-00409-Y(A) IN CRIMINAL DISTRICT\n                   COURT NO. 7 DALLAS COUNTY\n\n       A LCALA, J., filed a dissenting opinion in which J OHNSON, J., joined.\n\n                                  DISSENTING OPINION\n\n       I respectfully dissent from this Court’s order that denies the motion for leave to file\n\nan application for a writ of prohibition filed by Roderick Harris, relator. In his instant\n\npleadings, relator seeks to prohibit the trial-court judge from requiring his post-conviction\n\nhabeas counsel to turn over trial counsel’s files to the State for the State to use in contesting\n\nrelator’s ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claims. Rather than deny leave to file, I\n\nwould file and set this application to determine whether relator is entitled to prohibition relief\n\nunder these circumstances.\n\f                                                                                        Harris - 2\n\n       There is no precedent from this Court that directly applies to the situation presented\n\nin this case. As a general matter, this Court has recently said that...",
