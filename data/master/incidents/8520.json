The jury\r\nassessed punishment at twenty-five years' imprisonment.  Bolton's sole issue on appeal\r\nis whether the evidence is factually sufficient to support the jury's verdict.  We affirm the\r\njudgment. \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Christopher Jones and several friends, including Gaylon Dixon, were playing cards,\r\ndrinking, and watching television in Jones' residence when four or five persons wearing\r\nmasks forcibly entered Jones' house and robbed them at gunpoint.  Jerial Williams testified\r\nthat there were five burglars, who were wearing masks, and that all of them had guns. \r\nWilliams testified that they forced him and his girlfriend to disrobe and that they beat him. \r\nKelli Jackson, Williams' girlfriend at the time...",
