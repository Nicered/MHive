The summaries may not be\n    cited or relied upon as they are not the official language of the division.\n  Any discrepancy between the language in the summary and in the opinion\n           should be resolved in favor of the language in the opinion.\n\n\n                                                                  SUMMARY\n                                                           February 18, 2021\n\n                                2021COA19\n\nNo. 18CA0598, People v.

The division further concludes that resisting\n\narrest under section 18-8-103(1)(a), C.R.S. 2020, is a lesser\n\nincluded offense of second degree assault on a peace officer under\n\nsection 18-3-203(1)(c), C.R.S. 2020.\n\fCOLORADO COURT OF APPEALS                                          2021COA19\n\n\nCourt of Appeals No. 18CA0598\nAdams County District Court No. 16CR1763\nHonorable Robert W.
