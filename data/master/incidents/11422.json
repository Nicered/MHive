  "description": "## 사건 정보\n\n**사건명**: James Michael BURLEY v. STATE\n**판결일**: 1998-02-13\n**법원**: Court of Criminal Appeals of Alabama\n**관할**: Alabama, AL\n\n**판사**: Cobb\n\n## 변호인\n\nKelly Dean Vickers, Wetumpka, for appellant., Bill Pryor, atty. gen., and Cedric B. Colvin, asst. atty. gen., for appellee.\n\n## 인용\n\n- 715 So. 2d 923\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\nCOBB, Judge.\nJames Michael Burley appeals the circuit court’s revocation of his probation. On June 23, 1997, Burley was placed on probation after pleading guilty to assault in the second degree and criminal mischief. After a hearing on September 5,1997, Burley’s probation was revoked and his 18-month sentence was reinstated.\nBurley contends that he did not receive the due process requirement of written notice of the allegations against him prior to his hearing. See, § 15-22-54, Ala.Code 1975. He acknowledges that he did not preserve this issue for appellate review by an objection in the circuit court. King v. State, 677 So.2d 1278 (Ala.Cr.App.1996) (the issue whether the defendant was given notice of alleged probation violations before the revocation hearing was waived from appellate review because it was not raised before or during the probation revocation hearing). However, Burley asks us to revisit the majority opinion in King, and upon doing so, to adopt the dissent in that case. In the dissent, Judge Taylor argued that a due process violation does not have to be preserved by objection to merit appellate review. See, King, 677 So.2d at 1279 (Taylor, J., dissenting). We decline to do so.\nBurley contends, and the State does not dispute, that the record does not contain a written order that satisfies the requirements of due process1 by reflecting the trial judge’s reasons for, and evidence relied upon in, revolting probation. See Rule 27.6(f), Ala. R.Crim.P.2; Wadsworth v. ...",
