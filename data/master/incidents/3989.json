  "description": "## 사건 정보\n\n**사건명**: Peck (Frank) v. Whorton\n**판결일**: 2014-06-12\n**법원**: Nevada Supreme Court\n**관할**: Nevada, NV\n\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\f                district court dismissed the petition without prejudice because the petition\n                was not \"brought to trial\" within 5 years as required by NRCP 41(e).\n                            We conclude that the district court erred in dismissing\n                appellant's petition pursuant to NRCP 41(e). There is no requirement\n                under NRS Chapter 34 for a petitioner to take further action after the\n                filing of the petition. Rather, NRS Chapter 34 places the obligation on the\n                district court to take the next action. See, e.g., NRS 34.740 (requiring the\n                clerk of the court to present the original petition promptly to a district\n                judge); NRS 34.745(1) (requiring the district judge to determine whether\n                an evidentiary hearing is required after reviewing the return, answer, and\n                all supporting documents which are filed).\n                            We nevertheless affirm the dismissal of the petition because\n                appellant failed to demonstrate a violation of due process in connection\n                with the prison disciplinary hearing. See Wyatt v. State, 86 Nev. 294, 298,\n                468 P.2d 338, 341 (1970) (holding that a correct result will not be reversed\n                simply because it is based on the wrong reason). In his petition, appellant\n                claimed that the rule he violated did not specify •what constitutes\n           ...",
