Ticer, Law Office of Mark A. Ticer, Dallas, for appellant.\nGerald Conley, Andrews &amp; Kurth, Dallas, for appellee.\nBefore Justices LAGARDE, WRIGHT, and FRANCIS.\n\nOPINION\nOpinion By Justice LAGARDE.\nWilliam J. Hone and Falk &amp; Fish, L.L.P. appeal the trial court's May 9, 2001 order dismissing all claims asserted against Bernard M. Hanafin for want of jurisdiction.[1] In their first issue, appellants contend five of the trial court's findings of fact reached the merits of the case, were conclusions of law, and were not supported by the evidence. In their second issue, it appears appellants contend five of the trial court's conclusions of law were in error. In a cross-point, appellee contends appellants failed to timely perfect this appeal. We sustain appellee's cross-point and dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction.\n\nProcedural Facts\nAppellants originally sued appellee and PyMaH Corporation for fraudulent inducement and attorney's fees. Appellants also sued PyMaH for breach of contract. Later, appellants added PC Liquidation Trust as a defendant. Appellee, a New Jersey resident, filed a special appearance to present a motion objecting to personal jurisdiction. On February 21, 2001, the trial court held a hearing on appellee's special appearance motion.[...",
