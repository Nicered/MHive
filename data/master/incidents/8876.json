  "description": "## 사건 정보\n\n**사건명**: David Albert Rodriguez v. State\n**판결일**: 2004-05-20\n**법원**: Court of Appeals of Texas\n**관할**: Texas, TX\n\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               \r\n\r\n\r\nIn The\r\nCourt of Appeals\r\nFor The\r\nFirst District of Texas\r\n____________\r\n\r\nNO. 01-04-00453-CR\r\n____________\r\n\r\nDAVID ALBERT RODRIGUEZ, Appellant\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF TEXAS, Appellee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Appeal from the 248th District Court\r\nHarris County, Texas\r\nTrial Court Cause No. 964130\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nMEMORANDUM  OPINION\r\n               Appellant pleaded guilty to the offense of aggravated kidnapping and, in\r\naccordance with his plea bargain agreement with the State, the trial court sentenced\r\nappellant to confinement for nine years.  Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal. \r\nWe dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n               In a plea-bargained case in which the punishment assessed does not exceed\r\nthe plea agreement, a defendant may appeal only those matters that were raised by\r\nwritten motion filed and ruled on before trial, or after obtaining the trial court’s\r\npermission to appeal.  Tex. R. App. P. 25.2(a)(2).\r\n\r\n               The trial court’s certification of appellant’s right to appeal in this case states\r\nthat this is a plea-bargained case and appellant has no right to appeal.  The record\r\nsupports the certification.  We must dismiss an appeal if the trial court’s certification\r\nshows there is no right to appeal.  See Tex. R. App. P. 25.2(d).\r\n\r\n               We also note that appellant waived his right to appeal.  See Buck v. State,\r\n45 S.W.3d 275, 278 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2001, no pet.).\r\n\r\n       ...",
