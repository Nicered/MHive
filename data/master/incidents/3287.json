  "description": "## 사건 정보\n\n**사건명**: The People of the State of New York v. David S. Smith\n**판결일**: 2016-04-29\n**법원**: Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York\n**관할**: New York, NY\n\n**판사**: Carni, Centra, Curran, Peradotto, Troutman\n\n## 인용\n\n- 138 A.D.3d 1497\n- 29 N.Y.S.3d 217\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\nAppeal from a judgment of the Monroe County Court (Douglas A. Randall, J.), rendered December 11, 2012. The judgment convicted defendant, upon his plea of guilty, of arson in the third degree.\nIt is hereby ordered that the judgment so appealed from is unanimously affirmed.\nMemorandum: Defendant appeals from a judgment convicting him upon his plea of guilty of arson in the third degree (Penal Law § 150.10 [1]). Contrary to defendant’s contention, the record establishes that he knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived the right to appeal (see generally People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]), and that valid waiver forecloses any challenge by defendant to the severity of the sentence (see id. at 255; see generally People v Lococo, 92 NY2d 825, 827 [1998]; People v Hidalgo, 91 NY2d 733, 737 [1998]).\nPresent — Centra, J.P., Peradotto, Carni, Curran and Troutman, JJ.\n...",
