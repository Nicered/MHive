  "description": "## 사건 정보\n\n**사건명**: Ralph KING v. STATE of Texas\n**판결일**: 1961-03-29\n**법원**: Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas\n**관할**: Texas, TX\n\n**판사**: Morrison, Woodley\n\n## 변호인\n\nChas. H. Dean, Plainview, for appellant., Leon B. Douglas, State’s Atty., Austin, for the State.\n\n## 인용\n\n- 344 S.W.2d 693\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\nMORRISON, Judge.\nOur prior opinion is withdrawn.\nThe offense is embezzlement; the punishment, 2 years.\nThe indictment in this case is fatally defective because it fails to allege the ownership of the funds which were embezzled. This is a matter of substance and may be raised at any time. See Ryan v. State, 76 Tex.Cr.R. 510, 176 S.W. 49; Osborne v. State, 93 Tex.Cr.R. 54, 245 S.W. 928; and Martin v. State, 144 Tex.Cr.R. 313, 162 S.W.2d 722.\nFor the defect pointed out, the judgment is reversed and the prosecution-is ordered dismissed.\nWOODLEY, P. J., absent.\n...",
