  "description": "## 사건 정보\n\n**사건명**: Ben Wiley JONES, Jr. v. The STATE of Oklahoma\n**판결일**: 1976-09-02\n**법원**: Court of Criminal Appeals of Oklahoma\n**관할**: Oklahoma, OK\n\n**판사**: Bliss, Brett, Bussey\n\n## 인용\n\n- 554 P.2d 1212\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\nORDER DENYING WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS AND ORDER MODIFYING SENTENCE OF DEATH TO LIFE IMPRISONMENT AT HARD LABOR\nBen Wiley Jones, Jr., files in this Court a Motion requesting this Court reverse the First Degree Murder conviction and Death Sentence he sustained in the Oklahoma County District Court, Case No. CRF-2221 and remand this cause for a new trial. His conviction was previously affirmed by this Court in Jones v. State, Okl.Cr., 542 P.2d 1316, and was before this Court pursuant to a collateral attack, Jones v. State, No. PC-76-396 (CCA, Okla., June 3, 1976).\nJones contends that the recent United States Supreme Court decisions have rendered Oklahoma’s homicide murder statute, 21 O.S.Supp.1973, § 701.1, et seq. unconstitutional. See Green v. Oklahoma, - U.S. -, 96 S.Ct. 3216, 49 L.Ed.2d - (1976); Justus v. Oklahoma, - U.S. -, 96 S. Ct. 3216, 49 L.Ed.2d - (1976); Lusty v. Oklahoma,-U.S. -, 96 S.Ct. 3217, 49 L.Ed.2d - (1976); Davis v. Oklahoma, - U.S. -, 96 S.Ct. 3217, 49 L.Ed.2d — (1976); Rowbotham v. Oklahoma, U.S. -, 96 S.Ct. 3218, 49 L.Ed.2d - (1976) and Williams and Justus v. Oklahoma, - U.S. -, 96 S.Ct. 3218, 49 L.Ed.2d - (1976).\nHe also reiterates the argument presented in Jones v. State, Okl.Cr., 542 P. 2d 1316, specifically that the First Degree Murder provision upon which he was con*1213victed, 21 O.S.Supp.1973, § 701.1, ¶ 9 is unconstitutional as it improperly incorporates by reference the provisions of 21 O.S.1971, § 843, and thus two punishments exist for Murder in...",
