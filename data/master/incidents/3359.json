Sbai\n**판결일**: 2016-02-01\n**법원**: Nevada Supreme Court\n**관할**: Nevada, NV\n\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n                               IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEVADA\n\n\n                      VICTORIA-JOY GODWIN,                                   No. 69646\n                                          Appellant,\n                                     vs.\n                      DRISS SBAI; AND BTISSAM GHALMI,                               SLED\n                                              Respondents.                           FEB 0 1 2016\n\n\n                                            ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL\n                                  This is an appeal from an order granting a motion to dismiss\n                      appellant's complaint. Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County;\n                      Kerry Louise Earley, Judge.\n                                  Our review of the documents submitted to this court pursuant\n                      to NRAP 3(g) reveals a jurisdictional defect. Specifically, the notice of\n                      appeal appears to be untimely filed under NRAP 4(a) because it appears\n                      that it was prematurely filed, before the entry of a final written judgment,\n                      and is therefore of no effect. See NRAP 4(a)(1); Rust v. Clark ety. School\n                      District, 103 Nev. 686, 747 P.2d 1380 (1987). Accordingly, we conclude\n                      that we lack jurisdiction, and we\n                                  ORDER this appeal DISMISSED.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     ...",
