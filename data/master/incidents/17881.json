No. 9383.\nSupreme Court of North Dakota.\nFebruary 16, 1978.\nAs Corrected March 2, 1978.\nRehearing Denied March 15, 1978.\n*115 Marvin D. Nordeng, State's Atty., and Jonathan T. Garaas, Asst. State's Atty., Fargo, for State of North Dakota; argued by Jonathan T. Garaas.\nFrederick D. Kraemer, Fargo, for respondent and appellant, D.S., a minor.\nPAULSON, Judge.\nThis is an appeal by a juvenile [hereinafter D.S.] from the order of adjudication *116 entered on June 3, 1977, by the Cass County Juvenile Court, finding D.S. guilty of the delinquent act of murder.[1] The juvenile court committed D.S. to the State Industrial School for a period of two years. Prior to the hearing on the delinquency charge, D.S. filed a motion to suppress the use of his confession, and the fruits obtained thereby, as evidence at the delinquency hearing. The motion to suppress was denied. D.S. asserts, on this appeal, that the juvenile court committed error when it denied the motion to suppress this evidence which resulted in prejudice to D.S. upon its admission at the delinquency hearing.\nThis Court's scope of review under the Uniform Juvenile Court Act, pursuant to § 27-20-56 of the North Dakota Century Code, is equivalent to the former procedure of trial de novo. McGurren v. S. T., 241 N.W.2d 690 (N.D.1976). This Court will independently review...",
