  "description": "## 사건 정보\n\n**사건명**: Judith L. PARSONS, Appellant v. the STATE of South Carolina, Respondent\n**판결일**: 1986-01-09\n**법원**: Supreme Court of South Carolina\n**관할**: South Carolina, SC\n\n## 인용\n\n- 347 S.E.2d 504\n- 289 S.C. 542\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\n289 S.C. 542 (1986)\n347 S.E.2d 504\nJudith L. PARSONS, Appellant\nv.\nThe STATE of South Carolina, Respondent.\nSupreme Court of South Carolina.\nJanuary 9, 1986.\n\nJan. 9, 1986.\n\nORDER\nThis appeal is from an order denying appellant's request for bond pending her trial for capital murder. The State moves to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the order is not directly appealable. We agree.\nA criminal defendant may not appeal until sentenced. State v. Robinson, 286 S.C. 173, 337 S.E. (2d) 204 (1985); State v. Hubbard, 277 S.C. 568, 290 S.E. (2d) 817 (1982). Therefore, the order denying bail was not directly appealable.\nAppellant also requests this Court to admit her to bail. Construing her petition for bail as a petition for writ of habeas corpus, we find she has failed to establish that she is being held without due process of law. Bailey v. MacDougall, 247 S.C. 1, 145 S.E. (2d) 425 (1965).\nAccordingly, the petition for bail is denied and this appeal is dismissed.\nIt is so ordered.\n...",
