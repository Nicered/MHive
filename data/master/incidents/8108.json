State\n**판결일**: 2005-12-07\n**법원**: Court of Appeals of Texas\n**관할**: Texas, TX\n\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  In The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCourt of Appeals\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNinth District of Texas at Beaumont\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNO. 09-05-113 CR\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFREDDIE LEE GARNER, Appellant\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF TEXAS, Appellee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Appeal from the Criminal District Court\r\n\r\n\r\nJefferson County, Texas\r\n\r\n\r\nTrial Cause No. 83485\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     MEMORANDUM OPINION \r\n\r\n\r\n\tAppellant, Freddie Lee Garner, appeals from the trial court's judgment adjudicating\r\nhim guilty of the July 15, 2000 offense of Aggravated Sexual Assault of a Child.  See Tex.\r\nPen. Code Ann. § 22.021 (Vernon Supp. 2005). (1)  In his sole issue, Garner contends that his\r\nplea was not entered voluntarily or knowingly in the original plea proceeding due to\r\nineffective assistance of counsel.  Because his notice of appeal was not timely, we have no\r\njurisdiction over the trial court's judgment.  We dismiss this appeal for want of jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n\tGarner was indicted for the July 15, 2000 felony offense of Aggravated Sexual\r\nAssault of a Child.  Id.  Under the Penal Code, the punishment range for this offense is a\r\nminimum sentence of five years to a maximum of life in prison.  See Tex. Pen. Code Ann.\r\n§12.32 (Vernon 2003).  In addition to imprisonment, an individual found guilty of\r\nAggravated Sexual Assault of a Child may be punished with a fine not to exceed $10,000. \r\nId.  \r\n\r\n\tGarner pled guilty to the indictment without the benefit of a plea bargain with the\r\nState.
