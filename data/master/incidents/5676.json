WR-74,238-01\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEX PARTE JOVELL WALLACE, Applicant\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON APPLICATION FOR A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS\r\nCAUSE NO. 02-11-6717 IN THE 24TH DISTRICT COURT\r\nFROM JACKSON COUNTY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n           Per curiam.\r\n \r\nO R D E R\r\n\r\n            Pursuant to the provisions of Article 11.07 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, the\r\nclerk of the trial court transmitted to this Court this application for writ of habeas corpus.  Ex parte\r\nYoung, 418 S.W.2d 824, 826 (Tex. Crim. App. 1967).  Applicant was convicted of delivery of a\r\ncontrolled substance in a drug free zone and sentenced to fifteen years’ imprisonment.  The\r\nThirteenth Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction. Wallace v.

Applicant alleges that had counsel investigated, she would have discovered\r\nthat the offense occurred nowhere near a school or other such property and therefore the drug free\r\nzone allegation was improper.  There is no response from the State nor from trial counsel in the\r\nrecord sent to this Court.\r\n            Applicant has alleged facts that, if true, might entitle him to relief.  Strickland v. Washington,\r\n466 U.S. 608 (1984); Ex parte Lemke, 13 S.W.3d 791,795-96 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000).  In these\r\ncir...",
