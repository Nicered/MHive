Sitton, Greensboro, for defendants-appellants.\nPARKER, Judge.\nAfter twenty years of bending and lifting in service of his employer, plaintiff's back suddenly gave way when he called on it once again to strain in performance of an assigned task. In most jurisdictions this alone would have been enough to sustain an award of compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Laws. Vol. 1A, Larson's Workmen's Compensation Laws, § 38.20; 58 Am.Jur., Workmen's Compensation, § 255; 27 N.C.L.R. 599. However, under decisions of the North Carolina Supreme Court, here controlling, an injury to be compensable under our Workmen's Compensation Law, G.S. § 97-1 et seq., must result from an accident, which is to be considered as a separate event preceding and causing the injury, and the mere fact of injury does not of itself establish the fact of accident. Jackson v. North Carolina State Highway Commission, 272 N.C. 697, 158 S.E.2d 865; Lawrence v. Hatch Mill, 265 N.C. 329, 144 S.E.2d 3; Pardue v. Blackburn Bros. Oil &amp; Tire Co., 260 N.C. 413, 132 S.E.2d 747; Harding v. Thomas &amp; Howard Co., 256 N.C. 427, 124 S.E.2d 109; Hensley v. Farmers Federation Co...",
