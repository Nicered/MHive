PHILLIP NATHAN KERCH v. THE STATE.\n\n      Phillip Nathan Kerch pled guilty to multiple offenses, including malice murder\nand felony murder, and was sentenced to life imprisonment. Subsequently, Kerch\nfiled a motion to withdraw guilty plea. The trial court denied the motion, and Kerch\nfiled this direct appeal. We lack jurisdiction.\n      In State v. Murray, 286 Ga. 258 (687 SE2d 790) (2009), the Supreme Court\nheld that “[i]f the underlying action is a murder case, this Court has jurisdiction of the\nappeal, regardless of whether the order being appealed is based on facts having some\nbearing on the underlying criminal trial.” Id. at 259 (1); see also Neal v. State, 290\nGa. 563, 572 (722 SE2d 765) (2012) (Hunstein, J., concurring).
