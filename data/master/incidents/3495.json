ARTHUR STARLING A/K/A RICKY STARLING v. THE STATE.\n\n      Arthur Starling a/k/a Ricky Starling was convicted of malice murder and\nnumerous other charges. The trial court denied his motion for new trial, and Starling\nfiled a direct appeal to this Court.\n      Under our Constitution, however, the Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction\nover “[a]ll cases in which a sentence of death was imposed or could be imposed.” See\nGa. Const. of 1983, Art. VI, Sec. VI, Par. III (8). Because a penalty of death can be\nimposed for the crime of murder, jurisdiction is proper in the Supreme Court. See\nOCGA § 17-10-30 (b); Neal v. State, 290 Ga. 563, 572 (722 SE2d 765) (2012)\n(Hunstein, J., concurring); see also State v. Thornton, 253 Ga. 524 (322 SE2d 711)\n(1984) (directing this Court to transfer “all cases in which either a sentence of death\nor of life imprisonment has been imposed upon conviction of murder”). Accordingly,\nStarling’s appeal is hereby TRANSFERRED to the Supreme Court for disposition.\n\n                                        Court of Appeals of the State of Georgia\n                                                                             09/10/2015\n                                               Clerk’s Office, Atlanta,______________...",
