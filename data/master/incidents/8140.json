Pursuant\r\nto Count II of the indictment in this cause, Applicant was convicted of robbery and sentenced\r\nto confinement for a term of six years.  Additionally, pursuant to Count III, Applicant was\r\nconvicted of theft of a firearm, and his sentence was assessed at eighteen months in a state\r\njail facility.  Applicant did not appeal either conviction or sentence. \r\n\r\n\tApplicant contends that the Texas Department of Criminal Justice is failing to credit\r\nhis sentences with pre-sentence jail time credit granted by the trial court as reflected on the\r\njudgments revoking Applicant's community supervision. \r\n\r\n\tFollowing a remand, with respect to Applicant's conviction under Count II, the trial\r\ncourt has found that Applicant is entitled to time credit toward the expiration of his six-year\r\nsentence for the period of time he spent in confinement from June 13, 2002 to June 19...",
