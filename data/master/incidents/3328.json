Adams, an Ohio death row inmate, appeals the district court’s order denying his petition for a writ of habeas *287corpus .filed under 28 -U.S.C. § 2254. We certified two claims for appellate review: (1) whether requiring Adams to wear a stun belt throughout trial denied him a fundamentally fair trial; and (2) whether Ohio’s lethal injection protocol violated the Eighth Amendment.

Following the penalty phase, the trial court followed the jury’s recommendation and sentenced Adams to death. On direct appeal, the Supreme Court of Ohio vacated Adams’s kidnapping conviction and the related specifications, but affirmed the remaining convictions and the death sentence. State v.
