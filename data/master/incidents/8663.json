The\r\ntrial court assessed punishment at 30 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.  In his sole\r\npoint of error, appellant contends that the trial court erred in admitting an in-court\r\nidentification of appellant because the identification was tainted by an impermissibly\r\nsuggestive pre-trial identification procedure.\r\n          We affirm.\r\nBackground\r\n          On February 12, 2003 at approximately 11:15 p.m., appellant and Shelton\r\nWatterson entered a Texaco gas station in Houston, wearing Halloween masks. \r\nAppellant pointed a gun at the store’s manager, Mohamed Guedda, and ordered him\r\nonto the floor.  The masked men then took money from the cash register and\r\ndemanded that Guedda open the safe, which was located in the store’s back office. \r\nOnce it was opened, appellant handed the gun to Watterson and began emptying the\r\nsafe.  At that point, Watterson spotted Peter Gobert, Guedda’s friend who had been\r\ntaking the garbage to the dumpster when the assailants entered the store.  Watterson\r\nthen ran out of the store...",
