Reliman, Brooklyn, NY, for Defendant., Shreve Ariail, United States Attorneys Office, Matthew Jacobs, Melody Wells, United States Attorney’s Office, Brooklyn, NY, for United States of America.\n\n## 인용\n\n- 232 F. Supp. 3d 257\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\nMEMORANDUM DECISION &amp; ORDER\nCOGAN, District Judge.\nBefore me is defendant’s motion to declare the Classified Information Procedures Act (“CIPA”), 18 U.S.C. app. Ill, unconstitutional as applied in this case because it violates defendant’s Fifth and Sixth Amendments rights and because the Government is using its declassification authority as a “sword” to deny defendant his rights to discovery under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Significantly, every court in the country, including the Second Circuit, that has addressed arguments that CIPA is unconstitutional, has rejected these challenges and upheld its constitutionality. See, e.g., In re Terrorist Bombings of U.S. Embassies in E. Africa, 552 F.3d 93 (2d Cir. 2008); United States v. Anderson, 872 F.2d 1508 (11th Cir. 1989); United States v.
