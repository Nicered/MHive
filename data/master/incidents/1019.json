State\n**판결일**: 2022-04-07\n**법원**: Nevada Supreme Court\n**관할**: Nevada, NV\n\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n                           IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEVADA\n\n\n                 MARK LEONARD SHARP,                                         No. 84237\n                                   Appellant,\n                               vs.\n                 THE STATE OF NEVADA,\n                                                                                  FILED\n                                   Respondent.

Sixth Judicial District Court, Humboldt County;\n                Michael Montero, Judge.\n                              This court's review of this appeal reveals a jurisdictional defect.\n                The notice of appeal was untimely filed. See NRAP 26(a); NRAP 26(c); see\n                also Edwards v. State, 112 Nev. 704, 918 P.2d 321 (1996). The district court\n                entered its order denying the motion on January 10, 2022. However,\n                appellant did not file the notice of appeal until February 11, 2022, two days\n                beyond the relevant appeal period. See NRAP 4(b). Because an untimely\n                notice of appeal fails to vest jurisdiction in this court, Lozada v...",
