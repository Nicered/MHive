Plaintiff contends that jurisdiction lies under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. and the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 and 1983. Defendant has moved the Court for an order dismissing the complaint on the grounds that it is barred by the Tennessee one-year Statute of Limitations in T.C.A. § 28-304, which reads in pertinent part as follows:\n\"... civil actions for compensatory or punitive damages, or both, brought under the federal civil rights statutes, and statutory penalties shall be commenced within one (1) year after cause of action accrued.\"\nIt has been held that in the absence of a special congressional provision, federal courts must apply state statutes of limitations to federal causes of action.
