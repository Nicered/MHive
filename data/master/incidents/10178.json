State\n**판결일**: 2001-04-12\n**법원**: Court of Appeals of Texas\n**관할**: Texas, TX\n\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n     TEXAS COURT OF APPEALS, THIRD DISTRICT, AT AUSTIN\n\n\n                                     NO. 03-01-00120-CR\n\n\n\n\n                                  Marvin Tealer, Appellant\n\n                                               v.\n\n                                The State of Texas, Appellee\n\n\n\n    FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF TRAVIS COUNTY, 390TH JUDICIAL DISTRICT\n         NO. 006718, HONORABLE JULIE H. KOCUREK, JUDGE PRESIDING\n\n\n\nPER CURIAM\n\n              Marvin Tealer pleaded guilty to aggravated assault, enhanced by a previous felony\n\nconviction. See Tex. Penal Code Ann. § 22.02 (West 1994). The district court adjudged him\n\nguilty and assessed punishment at imprisonment for nineteen years as called for in a plea bargain\n\nagreement.\n\n              The clerk’s record contains a written waiver of appeal signed by appellant, his\n\nattorney, and the trial court. This document, which reflects a knowing and voluntary waiver of\n\nthe right to appeal, was signed after sentence was imposed in open court. A defendant who\n\nknowingly and intelligently waives his right to appeal may not thereafter appeal without the\n\nconsent of the trial court. Ex parte Dickey, 543 S.W.2d 99 (Tex. Crim. App. 1976); see also\n\nHurd v. State, 548 S.W.2d 388 (Tex. Crim. App. 1977); Reed v. State, 516 S.W.2d 680 (Tex.\n\fCrim. App. 1974). There is nothing in the record to indicate that appellant has the court’s\n\npermission to pursue this appeal.\n\n              The appeal is dismissed.\n\n\n\nBefore Justices Kidd, B. A. S...",
