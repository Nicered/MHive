  "description": "## 사건 정보\n\n**사건명**: William Williford v. the State\n**판결일**: 1897-12-01\n**법원**: Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas\n**관할**: Texas, TX\n\n**판사**: Henderson\n\n## 변호인\n\nSeay  Seay,  for appellant.\n\n Mann Trice,  Assistant Attorney-General, for the State.\n\n## 인용\n\n- 42 S.W. 972\n- 38 Tex. Crim. 393\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\nAppellant was convicted of murder in the second degree, and his punishment assessed at twenty-one years in the penitentiary; hence this appeal.\nAppellant complains of this portion of the charge of the court on self-defense: \"All self-defense rests upon necessity. Where there is no necessity to kill, it can not be self-defense.\" This is law. Under peculiar circumstances, it would be necessary to qualify or explain what is meant by necessity. If the necessity was apparent only, then the charge might be calculated to mislead the jury, to the injury of the appellant; but, if the necessity was real, there is no injury in the charge. Apparent necessity must be as pressing and imminent as real necessity. The charge of the court is not treated fairly; for, when we read it altogether, it does not convey the idea that the necessity in this case must be real, and not apparent. Upon self-defense the court instructed the jury as follows: \"All self-defense rests upon necessity. Where there is no necessity to kill, it can not be self-defense; but a reasonable apprehension of death or great bodily harm will excuse a party using all necessary force to protect his life or person, and it is not necessary that, there should be actual danger, provided he acted upon a reasonable apprehension of danger as it appeared to him from his standpoint at the time; and in such case the party acting under such real or apparent danger is in no event bound to retreat in order to avoid the necessity of killing ...",
