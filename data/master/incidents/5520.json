Parsons, Catherine Noel Steffes, Baton Rouge, LA, for Debtor.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\nDOUGLAS D. DODD, Bankruptcy Judge.\nDebtor Dean Bordelon seeks to exempt from his bankruptcy estate $355,130 in life insurance proceeds deposited into a trust from which he benefits. Creditor Royal Alliance Associates, Inc. (\"Royal\") objects to the exemption claim.[1] Bordelon is not entitled to the exemption.\n\nFACTS\nThe debtor filed chapter 7 on March 3, 2010. He claimed as exempt $355,130 in life insurance proceeds paid, on account of the June 2004 death of his mother, Mary Lou Reifel, into the \"Dean Alexander Bordelon Trust\" (\"DAT\").[2] The debtor is the sole DAT beneficiary. Bordelon's exemption claim is based on La. R.S. 22:647,[3] which exempts the proceeds of a life insurance policy from liability \"for any debt of the beneficiary ... existing at the time the proceeds ... are made available for [the beneficiary's] own use.\" (Emphasis added.) The debtor's declaration recites that the DAT received the final payment from Reifel's life insurance policy on February 15, 2006,[4] more than four years before the debtor's chapter 7 filing. The debtor's schedules and the court's claims register establish that almost all of Bordelon's debts arose after February 15, 2006,[5] and thus after the DAT received the life insurance proceeds.\nRoyal's claim ...",
