App. 566 (1980)\n269 S.E.2d 69\nTAFT\nv.\nTHE STATE.\n59693.\nCourt of Appeals of Georgia.\nSubmitted April 15, 1980.\nDecided May 9, 1980.\nA. Frank Grimsley, for appellant.\n*568 Gary Christy, District Attorney, for appellee.\nMcMURRAY, Presiding Judge.\nDefendant was indicted and convicted of the offenses of kidnapping and rape. Defendant appeals contending that the trial court erred in denying his motion for new trial. Held:\n1. The usual general grounds of the motion for new trial are deemed abandoned inasmuch as there is no argument or citation of authority raised which is relevant to such issues. Rule 15 (c) (2); Code Ann. § 24-3615 (c) (2).\n2. Due to the absence of any special plea of insanity, the *567 defendant's request for a psychiatric examination lay within the discretion of the trial court, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying the request. Lewis v. State, 239 Ga. 732 (2) (238 SE2d 892); Holsey v. State, 235 Ga. 270, 272 (3) (219 SE2d 374); Coffee v. State, 230 Ga. 123, 124 (1) (195 SE2d 897).\n3. Defendant contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion for change of venue based on allegedly prejudicial pretrial publicity. In order to support a finding that he did not receive a fair trial, defendant \"must show (1) that the setting of the trial was inherently prejudicial or (2) that the jury selection process showed actual prejudice to a degree that rendered a fair trial impossible.\" Street v. State, 237 Ga. 307, 311 (1) (227 SE2d 750...",
