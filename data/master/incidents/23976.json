Crim. 250\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\nThis is an original petition for a writ of habeas corpus brought by David Leon O'Hara. In his petition O'Hara alleges that he is being unlawfully imprisoned in the penitentiary at McAlester, Okla., by the warden, C. P. Burford. He alleges that his imprisonment is by virtue of his conviction in the district court of Grady county, Okla., judgment and sentence of him to the penitentiary for 20 years for the crime of robbery with firearms. As grounds for the writ of habeas corpus he makes, in substance, the following allegations, that he was committed purely as a result of a criminal conspiracy, that he was unlawfully deprived of a large sum of money by a spurious search warrant and seizure, which sum of money was never established as having been lost in a robbery case, that he was not accorded a speedy preliminary hearing and arraignment on the information, that the trial of the case wherein he was convicted was lacking in fairness and impartiality, that the court erred in not granting a new trial, that in consequence of the foregoing the trial court lost jurisdiction to pronounce the judgment and sentence.\nThis court has repeatedly held that inquiry in habeas corpus is limited to the questions, did the trial court have jurisdiction of the subject matter, of the petitioner's person and authority under the law to pronounce the judgment and sentence rendered.
