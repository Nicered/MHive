On November 30, 1995, in the Rankin County Circuit Court, Travis Wicker pleaded guilty to murder and two counts of aggravated assault. Wicker was sentenced to a life sentence for the murder charge and twenty years for each aggravated assault charge. All sentences were to be served consecutively in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections.\n¶ 2. On July 26, 2007, Wicker filed a motion to vacate his sentence. The trial court denied Wicker's motion, finding that it was procedurally barred and, regardless of the procedural bar, without merit. Wicker now appeals, asserting the following: (1) his right against double jeopardy was violated; (2) his indictment was defective; (3) his trial counsel was ineffective; and (4) the trial court erred in finding his motion for relief was time-barred. Finding no merit, we affirm.\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n¶ 3. A trial court's denial of post-conviction relief will not be reversed absent a finding that the trial court's decision was clearly erroneous.
