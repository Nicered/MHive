Super. 30 (1978)\n383 A.2d 437\nSTATE OF NEW JERSEY, PLAINTIFF-RESPONDENT,\nv.\nHALIL TERNAKU, DEFENDANT-APPELLANT.\nSuperior Court of New Jersey, Appellate Division.\nArgued January 9, 1978.\nDecided January 30, 1978.\n*31 Before Judges MICHELS, PRESSLER and BILDER.\nMr. Robert J. Miller argued the cause for appellant (Mr. Andreas A. Boyadjis, attorney; Mr. Bradford R. Day on the brief).\nMr. Larry R. Ertzweiler, Deputy Attorney General, argued the cause for respondent (Mr. William F. Hyland, Attorney General of New Jersey, attorney).\nThe opinion of the court was delivered by MICHELS, J.A.D.\nFollowing plea negotiations defendant pleaded guilty to robbery and was sentenced to State Prison for five to seven years, to be served consecutively to a New York State sentence then being served. Defendant appeals, contending solely that his conviction should be reversed because the trial judge erred in denying his pretrial motion to dismiss the indictment for violating the Interstate Agreement on Detainers to which New Jersey is a party. See N.J.S.A. 2A:159A-1 et seq.\nDefendant was indicted in Warren County for possession of a dangerous knife, armed assault with intent to rob, armed robbery and entering without breaking with intent to steal on July 11, 1974. The State was unable to locate defendant until June 1975 when it was discovered that he was an inmate in the Clinton Correctional Facility at Dannemora, *32 New York. A warrant was filed as a detainer with the New York authorities...",
