  "description": "## 사건 정보\n\n**사건명**: Commonwealth of Virginia v. Ethel Mae Cunningham\n**판결일**: 1999-09-14\n**법원**: Charlottesville County Circuit Court\n**관할**: Virginia, VA\n\n**판사**: Hogshire\n\n## 인용\n\n- 49 Va. Cir. 491\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\nBy Judge Edward L. Hogshire\nThe Defendant, facing a charge of murder, has moved to suppress certain statements made by her to the police. For the reasons stated below, the motion is denied.\nThe first statement in question occurred at the scene of the incident. When police arrived, they found the Defendant alone in the bedroom of her house with the victim, either dead or near death, lying beside her on the bed. Several policemen entered the house with weapons drawn in response to an Emergency 911 call from a female, who may have identified herself as the person who shot the victim. One of the officers, upon entering the room, immediately asked about the location of the weapon and the identity of the assailant. At that time, the Defendant responded, “I shot him.” Defendant had not been advised of her Miranda rights prior to her statement. The Commonwealth concedes that after this statement, Defendant was taken into custody and was therefore entitled to advisement of her Miranda rights before any statements made by her could be used as evidence. However, the Commonwealth maintains that Defendant was not in police custody at the scene until after she identified herself as the person who shot the victim; consequently, argues the Commonwealth, because the Defendant made the statement freely and voluntarily, it may be introduced as evidence.\nThere is no dispute that “Miranda applies only to ‘custodial interrogation,’ which means ‘questioning initiated by law enforcement officers *4...",
