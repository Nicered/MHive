PD-0176-10\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARK DERICHSWEILER, Appellant\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nv.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF TEXAS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON STATE'S PETITION FOR DISCRETIONARY REVIEW\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THE SECOND COURT OF APPEALS\r\n\r\n\r\nDENTON COUNTY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\tKeller, P.J., filed a concurring opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tI think the Court misconstrues the opinion of the court of appeals.  The Court believes that\r\nthe crux of that opinion is whether the officer had reasonable suspicion with respect to a specific\r\npenal code offense.  That is an interesting issue, but it is not in the case, and it was not the issue that\r\nwas briefed by the parties.\r\n\r\n\tBefore making a stop, an officer must have reasonable suspicion that a person \"is, has been,\r\nor soon will be\" engaged in criminal activity. (1)  The court of appeals cites that proposition correctly, (2)\r\nbut the gist of its opinion is that there must be reasonable suspicion that a person actually \"is\"\r\nengaged in illegal activity. (3)  Here, there was instead reasonable suspicion that appellant \"soon would\r\nbe\" engaged in criminal activity.  That is sufficient under the law.\r\n\r\n\tLike the Court, I would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.  Because the Court\r\nanalyzes an issue that is not before it, I join its judgment only.\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\nFILED: January 26, 2011\r\n\r\nPUBLISH\r\n1.   Crain v. State, 315 S.W.3d 43, 52 (Tex. Crim.
