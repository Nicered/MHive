COBB Et Al.\n**판결일**: 1915-11-16\n**법원**: Supreme Court of Oklahoma\n**관할**: Oklahoma, OK\n\n**판사**: Devereux\n\n## 변호인\n\nBrainerd   Davis, B.E. Nussbaum,  and  Leopold   Cochran,  for plaintiffs in error.\n\n Thomas H. Owen, Joseph C. Stone,  and  Summer J. Lipscomb,  for defendants in error.\n\n## 인용\n\n- 153 P. 134\n- 52 Okla. 654\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\nThe plaintiffs in error urge that the trial court committed *Page 658 \nerror in admitting parol evidence that John O. Cobb had the patent to this land issued in the name of Henry C. Cobb to hold in trust for himself and the other children of John O. Cobb by a previous marriage, on the ground that parol evidence is not admissible to prove an express trust. But the trust in this case was fully executed when Henry C. Cobb, the trustee, executed and delivered the deed to his sisters (Logan v. Brown,20 Okla. 334, 95 P. 441, 20 L. R. A. [N. S.] 298), and the evidence was clearly competent to rebut the allegation of fraud. The cause of action set out in the plaintiffs' petition on which they sought to subject this land to the payment of their judgments, was that Henry C. Cobb conveyed it to Mrs. McCaffrey without consideration and with intent to hinder and delay the plaintiffs in the collection of their claims, and that the land was received by Mrs. McCaffrey with full knowledge of such intent and to assist Henry C. Cobb in his unlawful purpose. To meet this issue, it was competent for the defendants to show what the true consideration of the deed was. In.2 Moore on Fraudulent Conveyances, p. 904, it is said:\n\"The recitals in a deed are not evidence as to third parties, and when a fact put at issue by the pleadings is particularly within the knowledge of the defendant, such as the consideration of a conveyance or transfer made by him, the burden of proof is on him to show the fact.\"...",
