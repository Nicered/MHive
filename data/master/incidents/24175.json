Lewis, all of Dothan, for appellant.\n\nIt was error for the court to permit opinion evidence by witness Shoffeitt as to the bullet removed from the head of deceased, the witness not being shown to be qualified as an expert.

J. Harris and they were separated &#8212; he living in Cincinnati. She and her brothers, including J. B. Collins, who had been killed by Ruby Lee, Buford Collins, and W. B. Finn, a half-brother who was called \"Buddy,\" were operating a taxicab business in Dothan, and used the telephone in a barber shop which they also had as their headquarters.\nThe jury could have found from the evidence that this appellant sent or caused to be sent a telegram to T. J. Harris in Cincinnati, advising him that his mother was dead, and to come at once. He received the telegram, although she denied sending it...",
