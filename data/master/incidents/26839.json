Gaggstatter, of Columbus, Ga., for appellants., H. H. Swift, of Columbus, Ga., and Hector M. Holmes, of Boston, Mass.

Its declared object was to provide a buneh builder for winding yam on a bobbin in a more substantial' and level manner than that attained by buneh builders then in general use, to the end that the overlapping and falling off of yam would be obviated, and thus prevent waste of material in changing bobbins. It is explained in the specifications that the bunch builder would cause the yam to wind on the base of the bobbin traversely in the form of the figure 8, and thus remain firmly in position. The specifications describe a complete bunch builder machine, one of the elements of which was a cam in the form of a disk “having a fluted or corrugated edge to provide alternately disposed grooves and lobes. The grooves are of greater length than the lobes.” The drawings add nothing to this description. Claim 1, which is typical of the other claims...",
