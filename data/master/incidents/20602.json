Frank Boynes, Defendant-Appellant\n**판결일**: 1967-05-22\n**법원**: Supreme Court of New Jersey\n**관할**: New Jersey, NJ\n\n**판사**: Per Curiam\n\n## 변호인\n\nMr. Richard B.

McGlynn, Assistant County Prosecutor, argued the cause for respondent, State of New Jersey (Mr. Brendan T. Byrne, County Prosecutor of Essex County, attorney).\nMr. Milton A. Waldor argued the cause for appellant.\n*304 The opinion of the court was delivered\nPER CURIAM.\nDefendant appeals from a verdict of murder in the second degree. His two major grounds of appeal are (1) that the trial court erred in admitting his written statement into evidence, and (2) that the conviction was contrary to the weight of the evidence.\nWe have examined the record and conclude that the finding of the trial judge that the defendant's confession was voluntary was justified. Additionally, the trial in this matter began before the decision in Miranda v. State of Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), and thus the doctrine of Miranda for which defendant argues, is not constitutionally required. Johnson v. State of New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 16 L.Ed.2d 882 (1966). We are not disposed to apply Miranda retrospectively. State v. Rudd, 49 N.J. 310 (1967).\nThere was ample evidence to sustain the verdict.\nWe have examined defendant's other grounds of appeal and find them without merit.\nAffirmed.\nFor affirmance  Chief Justice WEINTRAUB and Justices JACOBS, FRANCIS, PRO...",
