Eckles, St. Louis, for appellant.\nWilliam L. Webster, Atty. Gen., Aundreia R. Alexander, Asst. Atty. Gen., Jefferson City, for respondent.\nREINHARD, Judge.\nDefendant was convicted by a jury of the offenses of second degree burglary, § 569.170, RSMo 1986, and third degree assault, § 565.070, RSMo 1986. The court sentenced him as a prior and persistent offender to concurrent prison terms of twelve years on the burglary conviction and one year on the assault conviction. After sentencing, movant filed a pro se Rule 29.15 motion. Movant did not appear for sentencing on May 10, 1991, and the motion court invoked the \"escape rule\" to bar the postconviction relief motion. He appeals his conviction and the denial of his Rule 29.15 motion. Pursuant to Rule 29.15(l) these appeals have been consolidated.[1] We dismiss defendant's appeal pursuant to the \"escape rule\".\nThe evidence reveals that the victim came home at night, found his back door open with the lock broken, and heard noises upstairs. He called the police and, when two officers arrived, they found defendant and Donald Bromwell upstairs. As one of the officers was going up the stairs, defendant threw a television at him. Defendant was apprehended...",
