Although Goodin now suggests that the evidence was insufficient, we cannot say that it was. The evidence was sufficient for the jury to conclude that the email was a ‘commercial electronic mail message,’ as that term is defined in 15 U.S.C. § 7702(2)(A), and that it did not come within the exception for ‘transactional or relationship messages.’ Furthermore, Goodin did not argue at trial that the e-mail was outside the scope of the statute. “A failure to give a jury instruction, even if in error, does not seriously affect the fairness and integrity of judicial proceedings if the defense at trial made no argument relevant to the om...",
