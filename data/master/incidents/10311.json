TRUDO, JUDGE PRESIDING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tJoe Shack Laird was indicted for intoxication manslaughter and felony failure to\r\nstop and render aid.  See Tex. Penal Code Ann. § 49.08 (West Supp. 2000); Tex. Transp. Code\r\nAnn. § 550.021 (West 1999).  Before trial on the merits, Laird filed a motion to suppress the\r\nblood sample taken from him by a paramedic on the night of the offense.  Laird urges that blood\r\ndrawn by this paramedic, who was an emergency medical services technician, was inadmissible\r\nbecause section 724.017(c) of the Transportation Code specifically excludes emergency medical\r\nservices personnel from the list of people qualified to draw blood in these circumstances.  See\r\nTex. Transp. Code Ann. § 724.017(c) (West 1999).  The trial court agreed and granted Laird's\r\nmotion to suppress.  On this appeal, the State asks us to infer that the legislature intended to\r\nexclude emergency medical services personnel from drawing blood only when they are responding\r\nto an emergency situation.  We are sympathetic to the State's position and believe its version of\r\nthe law may be more reasonable, but we feel constrained by the plain language of the statute to\r\naffirm the trial court's ord...",
