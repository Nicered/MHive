Relator contends that the district court entered an order designating issues\r\non July 6, 2006.\r\n\r\n\t In these circumstances, additional facts are needed.  The respondent, the judge of the 176th\r\nDistrict Court of Harris County, is ordered to file a response with this Court by finding that no such\r\napplication has been filed, by having the District Clerk submit the record on such habeas corpus\r\napplication, or by setting out the reasons that no findings have been made since the order designating issues\r\nwas entered.  This application for leave to file a writ of mandamus will be held in abeyance until the\r\nrespondent has submitted the appropriate response.  Such response shall be submitted within 30 days of\r\nthe date of this order.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nFiled: August 22, 2007\r\n...",
