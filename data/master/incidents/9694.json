The court found\r\nappellant guilty, and assessed his punishment at 20 years confinement. \r\n\r\n\tCounsel has filed a brief stating his opinion that the appeal is frivolous.  The\r\nbrief meets the minimum requirements of Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738, 744,\r\n87 S. Ct. 1396, 1400 (1967), by presenting a professional evaluation of the record and\r\nstating why there are no arguable grounds of error on appeal.  See Gainous v. State,\r\n436 S.W.2d 137, 138 (Tex. Crim. App. 1969).\r\n\r\n\tCounsel certifies that the brief was delivered to appellant, and he was advised\r\nhe had a right to file a pro se response.  Thirty days have passed, and appellant has\r\nnot filed a pro se response. \r\n\r\n\tWe have reviewed the record and counsel's brief.  We hold there are no\r\narguable grounds for appeal.\r\n\r\n\tWe affirm...",
