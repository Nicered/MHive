Sentence was duly passed upon him and he appeals.  His assignment of error is that unauthenticated fingerprint evidence was adduced against him.  Our review of the record refutes the contention, and we find no error of law or insufficiency of evidence in his trial.\n    \n    \n      2\n      Affirmed.\n    \n    \n      \n        *\n         United States District Judge, sitting by designation\n      \n    \n    ...",
