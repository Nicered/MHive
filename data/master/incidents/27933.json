The cause was submitted on the 14th day of March, 1922, at which time no appearance was made by counsel representing the plaintiff in error to orally argue the cause. No brief has been filed in behalf of plaintiff in error.\nRule 9 of this court (12 Okla. Cr. viii, 165 Pac. x) provides:\n\"When no counsel appears, and no briefs are filed, the court will examine the pleadings, the instructions of the court and the exceptions taken thereto, and the judgment and sentence, and if no prejudicial error appears, will affirm the judgment.\"\nAn examination of the pleadings, instructions, and judgment and sentence discloses no prejudicial error, and the judgment is accordingly affirmed. *Page 409 ...",
