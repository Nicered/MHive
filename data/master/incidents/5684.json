We affirm.\r\n            Appellant entered a negotiated plea of guilty and the trial court placed him on deferred\r\nadjudication community supervision for five years.  The State subsequently filed a motion to\r\nadjudicate guilt based on allegations Appellant had violated the terms and conditions of community\r\nsupervision.  Appellant entered a plea of true to the allegation that he committed aggravated robbery\r\nsince being placed on community supervision.  The trial court revoked Appellant’s community\r\nsupervision, adjudicated him guilty of evading arrest, and assessed his punishment at confinement\r\nin the state jail for two years.  \r\n            Appellant’s court-appointed counsel has filed a brief in which he has concluded that the\r\nappeal is wholly frivolous and without merit.  The brief meets the requirements of Anders v.\r\nCalifornia, 386 U.S. 738, 87 S. Ct. 1396, 18 L. Ed. 2d 493, reh. denied, 388 U.S. 924, 87 S. Ct. 2094,\r\n18 L. Ed. 2d 1377 (1967), b...",
