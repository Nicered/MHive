AP-76,763 &amp; AP-76,764\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEx parte JESUS DE LEON, Applicant\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON APPLICATIONS FOR HABEAS CORPUS\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSE NOS. 06-CR-0405-G &amp; 06-CR-2746-G\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE 404TH DISTRICT COURT\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM CAMERON COUNTY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\tKeller, P.J., filed a concurring opinion in which Johnson and Cochran,\r\nJJ., joined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe plea agreement provided that applicant waived his right to appeal, applicant's attorney\r\nprovided an affidavit saying that his understanding was that no appeal would be forthcoming, and\r\nthe habeas judge found that applicant breached the plea agreement by appealing.  I do not think that\r\nthe pre-printed nature of the waiver of appeal makes it ambiguous, nor do I think that the trial judge\r\ncan retroactively override a waiver of appeal after he has accepted the plea agreement.  The habeas\r\njudge's finding that applicant breached the plea agreement first appears to me to be supported by the\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\n\tBut it does not matter.  The plea agreement contains no \"partial remedies\" clause.  That is,\r\nthere is no provision that says that, if applicant breaches the agreement by appealing, the State can\r\nprosecute applicant's brother while the remainder of the plea agreement remains in force.  Absent \r\na partial remedies clause, the State has three choices when a defendant breaches the plea agreement:\r\n(1) request specific performance, if that is possible, (1) (2)...",
