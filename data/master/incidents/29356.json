All of said indictments, it is insisted, having been found on the same evidence, and on account of the same transaction, are therefore claimed to be for one and the same supposed offense. An application for habeas corpus for the purpose and under the circumstances for which this was made is certainly novel and without precedent in the courts of this state. It would seem to have long since been much too well established by the common law as well as our statutes that an indictment not void upon its face, regularly returned to and pending in a court having jurisdiction thereof, could only be disposed of by some appropriate proceeding *Page 144 \nin such court for an experiment such as the present. The practice at common law in the court of King's Bench is thus stated in Wilmont's Opinion, 106 (Hurd on Habeas Corpus, 331...",
