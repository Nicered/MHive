Fox, Walter J.\n**판결일**: 2008-11-14\n**법원**: Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\n**관할**: USA, Federal\n\n**판사**: Cudahy\n\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n                            In the\n\nUnited States Court of Appeals\n              For the Seventh Circuit\n\nNos. 07-3830 and 07-3831\n\nU NITED S TATES OF A MERICA,\n                                                Plaintiff-Appellee,\n                                v.\n\nW ALTER J. F OX AND R ODNEY S YKES,\n                                          Defendants-Appellants.\n\n\n           Appeals from the United States District Court\n              for the Western District of Wisconsin.\n            No. 07-CR-101-S—John C. Shabaz, Judge.\n\n\n\n  A RGUED S EPTEMBER 9, 2008—D ECIDED N OVEMBER 14, 2008\n\n\n\n\n Before B AUER, C UDAHY, and W OOD , Circuit Judges.\n  C UDAHY, Circuit Judge. Rodney Sykes and Walter Fox\npleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute and to\npossess with intent to distribute crack cocaine. Each\ndisagrees with the application of the Sentencing Guide-\nlines to the facts of his case and contends that his sen-\ntence is unreasonable. Sykes argues that the district court\nimproperly increased his base offense level on the basis\nthat he was an organizer of the offense, and Fox contends\nthat the drug quantity for which he was responsible\n\f2                                 Nos. 07-3830 and 07-3831\n\nwas miscalculated. We find that Sykes is entitled only to\na limited remand under Kimbrough v. United States, 128\nS. Ct. 558, 564, 169 L. Ed. 2d 481 (2007), but that Fox’s\nsentence must be vacated and remanded for reconsid-\neration of the applicable drug quantity.1\n\n\n                      I. Ba...",
