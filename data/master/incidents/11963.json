State\n**판결일**: 1996-08-21\n**법원**: District Court of Appeal of Florida\n**관할**: Florida, FL\n\n**판사**: Schwartz, C.J., and Gersten and Goderich\n\n## 인용\n\n- 679 So. 2d 321\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\n679 So. 2d 321 (1996)\nJohn CLARK, Appellant,\nv.\nThe STATE of Florida, Appellee.\nNo. 95-2638.\nDistrict Court of Appeal of Florida, Third District.\nAugust 21, 1996.\nRehearing Denied October 2, 1996.\nBennett H. Brummer, Public Defender and Manuel Alvarez, Assistant Public Defender, for appellant.\nRobert A. Butterworth, Attorney General and Richard L. Polin, Assistant Attorney General, for appellee.\nBefore SCHWARTZ, C.J., and GERSTEN and GODERICH, JJ.\nSCHWARTZ, Chief Judge.\nThe defendant appeals from his convictions and sentences on two counts of lewd assault after a jury trial.\n\nI.\nThe primary evidence against Clark was the result of DNA testing which established, to a disputed degree of likelihood, that the defendant was the father of the victim's child. The primary issue raised in this appeal is the correctness of the trial court's determination, rendered after an extensive Frye[1] hearing in which three nationally recognized experts testified for the state, that DNA match probability calculations rendered under the \"product rule\" were properly deemed admissiblewithout reference to and, indeed, to the exclusion of the so-called \"ceiling principle\" reflected in a 1992 preliminary report of the National Research Council.
