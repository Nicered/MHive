First, I disagree with the majority deciding this issue\r\nbased on the parents' intent to deprive the rapist of his used condom.  I do not feel that a\r\ntheft was committed when the victim's mother went to her parents house, opened her\r\nbrother's truck using a spare key, and took the used condom her daughter told her was\r\nbehind the seat on the floor of the truck.  Although the victim's mother entered her\r\nbrother's truck without his knowledge, she did not do so with intent to deprive him of\r\nproperty.  Similar to other used hygiene items such as a used bandage or used tissue, the\r\nused condom had no value.  Therefore, appellant had no property right to the item taken\r\nfrom his truck. (1)  If appellant had a property right to the condom containing his DNA, then\r\nwouldn't the victim also have an equal property right to that condom since it also contained\r\nher DNA?  Because of the specific circumstances of this case, I do not think that a law was\r\nbroken to obtain this evidence, and I do not think Article 38.23 applies.  Thus, the condom\r\nshould be admissible.\r\n\r\n\tSeco...",
