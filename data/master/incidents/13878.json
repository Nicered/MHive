David Harris SINGER\n**판결일**: 1991-08-06\n**법원**: District Court of Appeal of Florida\n**관할**: Florida, FL\n\n**판사**: Barkdull, Gersten, Levy\n\n## 변호인\n\nOlle, St. Louis, Macaulay & Zorrilla, and Raymond L. Robin, Miami, for appellant., William J. Motyczka, and Marlene Leon-Rubido, Miami, for appellee.\n\n## 인용\n\n- 584 So. 2d 119\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\nPER CURIAM.\nAppellant, Corporate Center Associates, Inc., appeals the dismissal with prejudice of its complaint to recover proceeds from a lease agreement. We reverse and remand.\nAppellant’s first amended complaint was dismissed for failure to state a cause of action. We reverse because we find that the complaint contained sufficient allegations to maintain a cause of action.\nA trial court abuses its discretion in dismissing a complaint with prejudice, without giving leave to amend, except where “there has been an abuse of the amendment privilege, or the complaint shows on its face that there is a deficiency which cannot be cured by amendment.” Affordable Homes v. Devil’s Run, Limited, 408 So.2d 679 (Fla. 1st DCA 1982).\n*120Accordingly we reverse and remand for further proceedings.\n...",
