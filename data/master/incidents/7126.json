(2)  Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and\r\nremand the case to that court for a harm analysis.\r\n\r\n\tAllow me to review the relevant facts:  Shortly after he was indicted for aggravated assault,\r\nappellant filed a pretrial motion in the trial court to suppress any oral statements that may have been taken\r\nfrom him in violation of the Fifth Amendment as interpreted in Miranda v.

All three of these witnesses testified, in relevant part, before...",
