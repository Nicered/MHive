Hinds, Albany, for appellant.\r\nP. David Soares, District Attorney, Albany (Christopher D. Horn of counsel), for respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court (Breslin, J.), rendered August 8, 2017 in Albany County, convicting defendant upon his plea of guilty of the crime of attempted robbery in the second degree.\r\nDefendant waived indictment, pleaded guilty to a superior court information charging him with attempted robbery in the second degree and waived his right to appeal. Supreme Court sentenced him to 4½ years in prison, followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appeals.\r\nWe affirm. Defendant's sole contention on appeal is that the sentence imposed is harsh and excessive. Such claim is precluded, however, by defendant's unchallenged appeal waiver (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 255-256 [2006]; People v Chapman, 160 AD3d 121...",
