During the assault, appellant stabbed Saunders in the chest with a\r\nknife, narrowly missing the heart.  The jury that heard this evidence found appellant guilty of\r\naggravated assault and assessed punishment at imprisonment for ten years and a $10,000 fine. \r\nTex. Penal Code Ann. § 22.02(a)(1) (West 1994). (1)  \r\n\r\n\tIn two points of error, appellant contends he did not receive effective assistance of\r\ncounsel at either stage of trial.  To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel at the\r\nguilt stage, an appellant must show that counsel made such serious errors that he was not\r\nfunctioning effectively as counsel and that these errors prejudiced the appellant's defense to such\r\na degree that he was deprived of a fair trial.
