  "description": "## 사건 정보\n\n**사건명**: The People of the State of New York v. Kevin Davis\n**판결일**: 2011-01-11\n**법원**: Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York\n**관할**: New York, NY\n\n## 인용\n\n- 80 A.D.3d 623\n- 914 N.Y.S.2d 667\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\n— Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Kings County (Gerges, J.), rendered April 6, 2008, convicting him of course of sexual conduct against a child in the first degree, sodomy in the second degree, criminal sexual act in the second degree (11 counts), rape in the second degree, and endangering the welfare of a child, upon a jury verdict, and imposing sentence.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution (see People v Danielson, 9 NY3d 342, 349 [2007]), we find that it was legally sufficient to establish the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

Upon reviewing the record here, we are satisfied that the verdict of guilt was not against the weight of the evidence (see People v Romero, 7 NY3d 633, 643 [2006]).\nThe defendant’s contention that 13 of the counts of the indictment were rendered duplicitous by trial testimony is not preserved for appellate review (see CPL 470.05 [2]; People v Drysdale, 295 AD2d 533 [2002]), and we decline to reach the issue in the exercise of o...",
