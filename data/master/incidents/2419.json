A jury found appellant guilty of the lesser-included offense of robbery.\n\nDuring the punishment phase, the trial court found one enhancement paragraph true and sentenced\n\nappellant to thirty-five years’ imprisonment. On appeal, appellant’s attorney filed a brief in which\n\nshe concludes the appeal is wholly frivolous and without merit. The brief meets the requirements\n\nof Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967). The brief presents a professional evaluation of the\n\nrecord showing why, in effect, there are no arguable grounds to advance. See High v. State, 573\n\nS.W.2d 807...",
