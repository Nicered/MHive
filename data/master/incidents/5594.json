  "description": "## 사건 정보\n\n**사건명**: Rendon, Ex Parte Frankie\n**판결일**: 2010-11-17\n**법원**: Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas\n**관할**: Texas, TX\n\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS\r\n\r\n\r\nOF TEXAS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNO. AP-76,352\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEX PARTE FRANKIE RENDON, Applicant\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON APPLICATION FOR A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM LUBBOCK COUNTY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tJohnson, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nD I S S E N T I N G   O P I N I O N\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe difficulty in this case arose because this Court's prescribed form for an application for\r\na writ of habeas corpus did not require what is now held to be required.  Today we change the rules,\r\nyet hold an applicant, who properly filed his application on the old form, to the new rules.   On a\r\nbasis of which he had no knowledge, we now dismiss his petition and tell him to refile.  This strikes\r\nme as unjust.  This Court's form created the problem, and this Court should not use that court-created problem to place a new burden on this applicant and other applicants who, as of the date of\r\nthe issuance of the Court's opinion, had properly filed applications on the old form.  I would\r\nconsider the merits of this application, and all others that were properly filed as of this date, and\r\npublish an opinion that would resolve the merits of this application and set out the new rules and writ\r\napplication form as the standard for applications not yet filed.  Because the Court does not do so, I\r\nrespectfully dissent.\r\n\r\n\r\nFiled: November 17, 2010\r\n\r\nPublish\r\n\r\n\r\n...",
