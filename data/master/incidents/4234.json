State\n**판결일**: 2013-09-11\n**법원**: Court of Appeals of Texas\n**관할**: Texas, TX\n\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n                    In The\n              Court of Appeals\nSixth Appellate District of Texas at Texarkana\n\n\n                  No. 06-13-00016-CR\n\n\n\n         LARRY WAYNE ADAMS, Appellant\n\n                            V.\n\n           THE STATE OF TEXAS, Appellee\n\n\n\n          On Appeal from the 3rd District Court\n               Anderson County, Texas\n                Trial Court No. 30793\n\n\n\n\n       Before Morriss, C.J., Carter and Moseley, JJ.\n        Memorandum Opinion by Justice Moseley\n\f                           MEMORANDUM OPINION\n         Although the State had charged Larry Wayne Adams with both intoxication manslaughter\n\nand manslaughter, the Anderson County jury1 found him not guilty of intoxication manslaughter\n\nbut convicted him of manslaughter with a deadly weapon finding.
