  "description": "## 사건 정보\n\n**사건명**: The People of the State of New York v.

In any event, the defendant was not deprived of a fair trial by the court’s conduct. \"The role of the *568Trial Judge is neither that of automaton nor advocate” (see, People v Yut Wai Tom, 53 NY2d 44, 46). The court’s function is to clarify the issues and to facilitate the orderly and expeditious progress of the proceedings.
