Adams\n**판결일**: 1999-12-17\n**법원**: Supreme Court of Alabama\n**관할**: Alabama, AL\n\n**판사**: Cook\n\n## 인용\n\n- 754 So. 2d 630\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\n754 So. 2d 630 (1999)\nBertha MOORE\nv.\nDale ADAMS and the City of Decatur.\n1981156.\nSupreme Court of Alabama.\nDecember 17, 1999.\n*631 R. Scott Anderson, Decatur, for appellant.\nRobert E. Morrow, Department of Public Safety Legal Unit, Montgomery, for appellee Dale Adams.\nJon R. Sedlak of Coleman &amp; Sedlak, Decatur, for appellee City of Decatur.\nCOOK, Justice.\nBertha Moore sued the City of Decatur and Dale Adams, in his individual capacity; Adams is a state trooper and a narcotics agent for the Alabama Bureau of Investigation (\"ABI\"). Moore alleged that she had been injured during the execution of a search warrant at her home. Her complaint alleged false imprisonment, the tort of outrage, trespass, assault and battery, negligence, and wantonness, and alleged that she had suffered emotional distress. The defendants filed motions for summary judgment based upon claims of discretionary-function immunity, § 6-5-338, Ala. Code 1975. The trial judge entered a summary judgment for the defendants; Ms. Moore appealed. We affirm.\nRule 56, Ala. R. Civ. P., sets forth a two-tiered standard for determining whether to enter a summary judgment. In order to enter a summary judgment, the trial court must determine: 1) that there is no genuine issue of material fact and 2) that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. In determining whether a summary judgment was properly entered, a reviewing court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant. See...",
