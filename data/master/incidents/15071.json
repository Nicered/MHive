State\n**판결일**: 1987-10-13\n**법원**: Court of Criminal Appeals of Alabama\n**관할**: Alabama, AL\n\n**판사**: Bowen\n\n## 인용\n\n- 516 So. 2d 937\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\n516 So. 2d 937 (1987)\nWilliam Earl HINES\nv.\nSTATE.\n8 Div. 875.\nCourt of Criminal Appeals of Alabama.\nOctober 13, 1987.\n*938 William Earl Hines, pro se.\nDon Siegelman, Atty.

A crime of incest committed before January 7, 1985, had a three-year statute of limitations. Alabama Code 1975, § 15-3-1 and § 15-3-5.\nThe statute of limitations is a jurisdictional matter. Spears v. State, 26 Ala. App. 376, 377, 160 So. 727 (1935). A constitutionally valid guilty plea only waives nonjurisdictional defects. Ex parte Horton, 456 So. 2d 1120, 1122 (Ala.1984).
