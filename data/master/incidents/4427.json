The government has filed an opposition.2 Defendants have each filed a reply and supplemental exhibits.3 Although unlikely, assuming that prejudice to one defendant would extend to the other provides a simpler analysis and greater protection for defendants’ right to an impartial jury. Accordingly, the Court considers the motions together.\nIn their motions, defendants assert that a transfer of venue is necessary pursuant to Rule 21(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and pursuant to the constitutional standard that the U.S. Supreme Court recently addressed in Skilling v. United States, 561 U.S. 358, 130 S.Ct. 2896, 177 L.Ed.2d 619 (2010). For the following reasons, the motions are DENIED without prejudice to defendants’ right to re-urge their motions following the receipt of juror questionnaires.\n\nSTANDARD OF LAW\n\nDue process requires a transfer of venue if “extraordinary local prejudice will prevent a fair trial.” Skilling, 130 S.Ct. at 2896 (citations and quotations omitted). Rule 21(a) similarly provides:\nUpon the defendant’s motion, the court must transfer the proceeding against that defendant to another district if the court is satisfied that so great a prejudice against the defendant exists in the transferring district that-the defendant cannot obtain a fair and impartial trial there....",
