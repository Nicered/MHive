  "description": "## 사건 정보\n\n**사건명**: Antonio Markeith O'Neal v. State\n**판결일**: 2014-02-06\n**법원**: Court of Appeals of Texas\n**관할**: Texas, TX\n\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n                    In The\n              Court of Appeals\nSixth Appellate District of Texas at Texarkana\n\n\n                  No. 06-13-00245-CR\n\n\n\n       ANTONIO MARKEITH O'NEAL, Appellant\n\n                            V.\n\n           THE STATE OF TEXAS, Appellee\n\n\n\n          On Appeal from the 6th District Court\n               Red River County, Texas\n              Trial Court No. 59CR1100\n\n\n\n\n       Before Morriss, C.J., Carter and Moseley, JJ.\n\f                                         ORDER\n\n       Antonio Markeith O’Neal pled no contest to aggravated robbery and was sentenced\n\nNovember 7, 2001, to ninety-nine years’ imprisonment. O’Neal filed a notice of appeal from\n\nthat judgment February 8, 2002, and that appeal was assigned cause number 06-02-00034-CR.\n\nThe clerk’s record in that matter was received by this Court March 4, 2002, and the reporter’s\n\nrecord was received May 3, 2002. After reviewing the appellate record, this Court determined\n\nthat it was without jurisdiction to decide O’Neal’s appeal because his notice of appeal was\n\nuntimely. Consequently, that case was dismissed for want of jurisdiction March 12, 2002.\n\n       The Court of Criminal Appeals has granted O’Neal an out-of-time appeal. In an effort to\n\nexpedite matters and to avoid duplication of effort, the clerk of this Court is ordered to transfer\n\nthe clerk’s and reporter’s records from O’Neal’s former appeal, cause number 06-02-00034-CR,\n\nto his current appeal, cause number 06-13-00245-CR.
