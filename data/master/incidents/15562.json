Lock and Lawrence A. Kalikow, Harrisburg, for appellant.\nRichard L. Guida, Harrisburg, for Com., appellee.\nBefore WIEAND, OLSZEWSKI and WATKINS, JJ.\n*472 WIEAND, Judge:\nWilliam S. Bradfield was found guilty by a jury of intentionally and deliberately murdering Susan Reinert and her two children, Karen and Michael. Post-verdict motions were dismissed, and Bradfield was sentenced to serve three consecutive life sentences. This appeal followed.\nSusan Reinert's battered body was discovered in the trunk of her car in Dauphin County on June 25, 1979. The bodies of her two children have never been found. Mother and children were last seen alive entering Ms. Reinert's car in Delaware County on June 22, 1979. Bradfield argues on appeal that he should not have been tried in Dauphin County because there was no evidence that a murder had been committed in that county.[1] We disagree.\n\"For a county to take jurisdiction over a criminal case, some overt act involved in that crime must have occurred within that county.\" Commonwealth v.
