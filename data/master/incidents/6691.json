State\n**판결일**: 2008-08-22\n**법원**: Court of Appeals of Texas\n**관할**: Texas, TX\n\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n      TEXAS COURT OF APPEALS, THIRD DISTRICT, AT AUSTIN\n\n\n                                       NO. 03-07-00413-CR\n\n\n\n                              Willie Dwayne Whitfield, Appellant\n\n                                                  v.\n\n                                   The State of Texas, Appellee\n\n\n     FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF MILAM COUNTY, 20TH JUDICIAL DISTRICT\n            NO. CR21,734, HONORABLE ED MAGRE, JUDGE PRESIDING\n\n\n\n                             MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n\n               Appellant Willie Dwayne Whitfield pled guilty to and was convicted of burglary of\n\na habitation with intent to commit sexual assault and of aggravated sexual assault. See Tex. Penal\n\nCode Ann. §§ 22.021 (West Supp. 2008), 30.02 (West 2003). After the jury found an enhancement\n\nparagraph (alleging that appellant was convicted of sexual assault in 1998) to be true, appellant was\n\nsentenced to life imprisonment as a habitual offender. See id. § 12.42 (West Supp. 2008).\n\n               Appellant’s appointed attorney has filed a brief concluding that the appeal is frivolous\n\nand without merit. The brief meets the requirements of Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738, 743-44\n\n(1967), by presenting a professional evaluation of the record demonstrating that there are no arguable\n\ngrounds to be advanced. See Penson v. Ohio, 488 U.S. 75, 80 (1988); Anders, 386 U.S. at 743-44;\n\nHigh v. State, 573 S.W.2d 807, 811-13 (Tex. Crim. App. 1978); Currie v. State, 516 S.W.2d 684,\n\n684 (Tex. Crim. App. 19...",
