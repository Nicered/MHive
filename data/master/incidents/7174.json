State\n**판결일**: 2007-10-17\n**법원**: District Court of Appeal of Florida\n**관할**: Florida, FL\n\n**판사**: Wallace\n\n## 인용\n\n- 965 So. 2d 1281\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\n965 So.2d 1281 (2007)\nDemetrius L. WALKER, Appellant,\nv.\nSTATE of Florida, Appellee.\nNo. 2D06-5655.\nDistrict Court of Appeal of Florida, Second District.\nOctober 17, 2007.\n*1282 WALLACE, Judge.\nDemetrius L. Walker appeals the summary denial of his motion to correct illegal sentence filed in accordance with Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.800(a). We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for resentencing.\n\nBackground\nWalker pleaded nolo contendere in two separate cases to four offenses: (1) battery on a law enforcement officer, §§ 784.03, .07(2)(b), Fla. Stat. (2005); (2) battery on a firefighter, §§ 784.03, .07(2)(b); (3) resisting an officer with violence, § 843.01, Fla. Stat. (2005); and (4) attempted robbery, §§ 812.13(2)(c), 777.04(1), Fla. Stat. (2005). The trial court sentenced him as a prison releasee reoffender (PRR) on all four counts and imposed four concurrent five-year sentences.\n\nThe Postconviction Court's Order\nWalker claimed in his postconviction motion that he is not subject to PRR sentencing in these cases because his offenses were not enumerated or forcible felonies under the PRR statute. See § 775.082(9)(a)(1), Fla. Stat. (2005). The postconviction court summarily denied Walker's motion. In support of its ruling, the postconviction court cited Jenkins v. State[1] and Brown v. State.[2]\n\nThe Impact of State v. Hearns\n\nWhen the postconviction court summarily denied Walker's rule 3.800(a) motion, it did not have the benefit of State v. Hearns, 961 S...",
