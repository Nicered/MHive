On appeal, the defendants assert the evidence was insufficient to support their\nconvictions, arguing the State failed to overcome the defense of duress. The defendants\nalso claim their right to a speedy trial was violated. Independently, Leon Denton argues\nhis convictions violate double jeopardy. Following our review, we affirm the judgments\nof the trial court.\n\n Tenn. R. App. P. 3 Appeal as of Right; Judgments of the Criminal Court Affirmed\n\nJ.
