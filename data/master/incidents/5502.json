  "description": "## 사건 정보\n\n**사건명**: Jay LIEBMAN v. MIAMI-DADE COUNTY CODE COMPLIANCE OFFICE\n**판결일**: 2011-02-09\n**법원**: District Court of Appeal of Florida\n**관할**: Florida, FL\n\n**판사**: Cortiñas, Emas, Ramirez\n\n## 변호인\n\nJay Liebman, in proper person., Pamela Jo Bondi, Attorney General, and Charles M.

Grantham v. Blount, Inc., 683 So.2d 538 (Fla. 2d DCA 1996). The complaint failed to give this ostensible defendant actual notice that a lawsuit was being commenced against her. Liebman’s attempted service of process upon this individual (in which the summons described the person to be served as “unknown John Doe # 5”) cannot serve to satisfy this notice requirement. Gilliam v. Smart, 809 So.2d 905, 909 (Fla. 1st DCA 2002) (“The service of process on an individual cannot be used to broaden the scope of the plead*1045ings to add a...",
