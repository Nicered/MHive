Defendant appeals to this Court pursuant to Rule 12-102(A)(1) NMRA 1998 (appeal from life sentence taken to the Supreme Court), alleging that the trial court erred by: (1) denying his proffered jury instructions on self defense and defense of others; (2) refusing to admit into evidence the State's charging instrument filed against a witness; (3) allowing the State to redact portions of Defendant's recorded statement; (4) failing to dismiss the indictment because the State did not present allegedly exculpatory evidence to the grand jury; (5) allowing the State to illustrate applicable law in an impermissible manner before the grand jury; and (6) allowing the State to amend the indictment to add the charge of depraved mind murder and in finding that Defendant had no right to a peremptory excusal of the trial court judge. We affirm Defendant's convictions.\n\nFACTS AND BACKGROU...",
