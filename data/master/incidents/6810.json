  "description": "## 사건 정보\n\n**사건명**: Leviyas Jamail Clayton v. State\n**판결일**: 2008-06-05\n**법원**: Court of Appeals of Texas\n**관할**: Texas, TX\n\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n                            NUMBER 13-03-00411-CR\n\n                            COURT OF APPEALS\n\n                  THIRTEENTH DISTRICT OF TEXAS\n\n                    CORPUS CHRISTI - EDINBURG\n\nLEVIYAS JAMAIL CLAYTON,                                                      Appellant,\n\n                                            v.\n\nTHE STATE OF TEXAS,                                                         Appellee.\n\n\n   On appeal from the 183rd District Court of Harris County, Texas.\n\n\n               MEMORANDUM OPINION ON REMAND\n       Before Chief Justice Valdez and Justices Yañez and Garza\n          Memorandum Opinion on remand by Justice Garza\n       Appellant, Leviyas Jamail Clayton, was convicted of murder and sentenced to thirty\n\nyears’ imprisonment. See TEX . PENAL CODE ANN . § 19.02(b) (Vernon 2003). On original\n\nsubmission, we found that the evidence adduced at trial was legally insufficient to sustain\n\nClayton’s conviction. See Clayton v. State, 169 S.W.3d 254 (Tex. App.–Corpus Christi\n\n2005), rev’d, 235 S.W.3d 772 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). The Texas Court of Criminal\n\nAppeals reversed, holding that the evidence met the standard for legal sufficiency. See\n\nClayton v. State, 235 S.W.3d 772, 782 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). We now consider on\n\nremand whether the evidence was factually sufficient to prove that Clayton committed\n\fmurder. Because we find that the evidence was factually sufficient, we affirm the judgment\n\nof the trial court.\n\n                                      I....",
