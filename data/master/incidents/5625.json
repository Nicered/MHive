Duane Kirby\n**판결일**: 2010-10-05\n**법원**: Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York\n**관할**: New York, NY\n\n## 인용\n\n- 77 A.D.3d 680\n- 908 N.Y.S.2d 354\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\nAppeal by the defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Orange County *681(Freehill, J.), rendered June 1, 2009, convicting him of burglary in the third degree, upon his plea of guilty, and imposing sentence.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.\nContrary to the defendant’s contentions, a review of the minutes of the plea proceedings clearly demonstrates that his plea of guilty was voluntarily, intelligently, and knowingly made (see People v Fiumefreddo, 82 NY2d 536, 543 [1993]; People v Callahan, 80 NY2d 273, 283 [1992]; People v Moissett, 76 NY2d 909, 910-911 [1990]; People v Harris, 61 NY2d 9, 16 [1983]; People v Nixon, 21 NY2d 338 [1967], cert denied sub nom. Robinson v New York, 393 US 1067 [1969]). Accordingly, the County Court providently exercised its discretion in denying the defendant’s motion to withdraw his plea of guilty (see People v Seeber, 4 NY3d 780 [2005]; People v Mann, 32 AD3d 865 [2006]; People v Kucharczyk, 15 AD3d 595 [2005]). Moreover, in light of the record herein, the defendant was not deprived of the effective assistance of counsel (see People v Ford, 86 NY2d 397, 404 [1995]; People v Brooks, 36 AD3d 929, 930 [2007]; People v Sherrill, 27 AD3d 588 [2006]; People v Weekes, 289 AD2d 599 [2001]; People v Clark, 254 AD2d 299 [1998]; People v Boodhoo, 191 AD2d 448 [1993]).
