Fahner, Mayer, Brown &amp; Platt, Chicago, Ill., for defendant.\nHoward Pearl, U.S. Atty., Chicago, Ill., for plaintiff.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\nLEINENWEBER, District Judge.\nDefendant, Norby Walters (\"Walters\"), was charged in a seven-count indictment with Racketeering, Racketeering Conspiracy, Mail Fraud, and Conspiracy. On April 13, 1989, in a trial before Judge Marovich of this court, a jury convicted Walters and co-defendant, Lloyd Bloom (\"Bloom\"), on six counts, including two counts of mail fraud. On September 17, 1990, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed all the convictions and remanded the case for a new trial on the ground that it had been an error to refuse to instruct the jury on the advice defendants received from counsel. 913 F.2d 388. Bloom subsequently requested assignment to Judge Marovich pursuant to General Rule 44(a). The case was therefore bifurcated for trial, and Walters is before this court on remand.\nDefendant now moves to dismiss the indictment, arguing that the evidence presented by the government during his first trial (\"Walters I\") is insufficient to support a guilty verdict on the mail fraud *1175 counts.[1] Defendant's motion raises several questions concerning the scope of the federal mail fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1...",
