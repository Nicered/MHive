Kelly Thomas, Jr.\n\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n        IN THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS OF TENNESSEE\n                         AT KNOXVILLE\n                                 May 18, 2016 Session\n\n          JEREME DANNUEL LITTLE v. STATE OF TENNESSEE\n\n                Appeal from the Criminal Court for Hamilton County\n                      No. 291007 Rebecca June Stern, Judge\n\n\n                No. E2015-01190-CCA-R3-PC – Filed August 19, 2016\n\n\nFollowing an evidentiary hearing, the Hamilton County Criminal Court granted the\nPetitioner, Jereme Dannuel Little, post-conviction relief and vacated his conviction for\nespecially aggravated kidnapping. On appeal, the State contends that the post-conviction\ncourt erred by concluding that the Petitioner received ineffective assistance of counsel\nbased on counsel‟s (1) failure to seek a severance of two counts of aggravated robbery\nfrom the especially aggravated kidnapping charge, either pre-trial or after judgments of\nacquittal were granted on the aggravated robbery charges; (2) failure to interview\nwitnesses from the store where the victim was allegedly kidnapped; and (3) decision to\ncall a witness to testify without first adequately interviewing that witness. Following our\nreview, we reverse the judgment of the post-conviction court and reinstate the\nPetitioner‟s conviction for especially aggravated kidnapping.\n\n Tenn. R.
