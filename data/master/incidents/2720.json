(Pro Tempore )\nThis criminal appeal arises from the First Judicial District Court, Caddo Parish, State of Louisiana. The defendant, Randy Anderson, was convicted of second degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment at hard labor without benefits, pursuant to La. R.S. 14:30.1.

He had been shot seven times: once to the top of the head, four times to the back, and twice to the abdomen. Shreveport police quickly suspected Timothy's brother, Randy Anderson (\"Randy\"), for the murder. The next day, Randy was apprehended by police after the car he was traveling in, which was owned by Sterling Ary, was stopped in Bossier City, Louisiana. Randy's guitar case was found in the backseat of the car. Inside the case, police found a 9mm handgun and a shirt with stains on it-suspected to be blood. Randy was arrested at that time.\nThe police investigation showed that Randy had purchased the gun several days before. Firearms testing confirmed that the shell casings found at the scene and the bullets recovered from Timothy's body were fired from the 9mm gun. Also, DNA analysis revealed that the blood on the shirt was consistent with Timothy's DNA. Randy was charged by a grand jury indictment with second degree murder, a violation of La. R.S....",
