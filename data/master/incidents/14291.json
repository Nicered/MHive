Frazier bases these contentions on his mistaken assertion that the city's complaint filed in circuit court charged him with the form of driving under the influence of alcohol contemplated by § 32-5A-191(a)(1).\nAs our Supreme Court stated in Ex parte Buckner, 549 So. 2d 451, 452 (Ala.1989):\n\"Alabama's D.U.I. statute, Ala.Code 1975, § 32-5A-191, provides that `[a] person shall not drive or be in actual physical control of any vehicle while: (1) there is 0.10 percent or more by weight of alcohol in his blood; (2) Under the influence of alcohol....'
