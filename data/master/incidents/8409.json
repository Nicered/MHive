Bragg, Abingdon, Virginia, for Defendant.\n\nOPINION SETTING FORTH REASONS FOR SENTENCE\nJONES, Chief District Judge.\nFor the reasons set forth in this opinion, I find it reasonable to sentence the defendant to a sentence below the advisory guideline range.\nA jury in this court convicted the defendant, Larry A. Clyburn, of conspiracy to manufacture 50 grams or more of methamphetamine (Count One); manufacturing 50 grams or more of methamphetamine (Count Two); possession of pseudoephedrine with intent to manufacture methamphetamine (Count Three); maintaining a place for the purpose of manufacturing methamphetamine (Count Four); endangering human life while manufacturing methamphetamine (Count Five); possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense (Count Six); and possession of a firearm by an unlawful user of a controlled substance (Count Seven). Following the verdict, I entered a judgment of acquittal as to Count Six, holding that the government had presented insufficient evidence that the defendant's admitted possession of a firearm was in furtherance of drug trafficking offense in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. § 924(c) (West 2000).
