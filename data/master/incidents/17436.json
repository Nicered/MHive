RUPE, Appellant.\nNo. 50,465\nSupreme Court of Kansas.\nOpinion filed October 27, 1979.\nJoseph L. Dioszeghy, of Lenexa, argued the cause and was on the brief for the appellant.\nMichael B. Buser, assistant district attorney, argued the cause and Robert T. Stephan, attorney general, and Dennis W. Moore, district attorney, were with him on the brief for the appellee.\nThe opinion of the court was delivered by\nKAUL, J.:\nFollowing a jury trial defendant-appellant, John L. *475 Rupe, was convicted of first degree felony murder (K.S.A. 21-3401) and of aggravated burglary (K.S.A. 21-3716). After denial of his motion for a new trial and sentencing on both counts, defendant appeals from the convictions and sentences. He specifies three points of error.\nThere is little dispute in the facts presented. Defendant and Martha L. Locke, the victim, had been involved in a rocky, unstable relationship for a number of years. Some of their problems stemmed from defendant's heavy drinking. Apparently defendant and Martha had been twice married and divorced and had lived together intermittently at other times. At the time of the events in question, defendant was residing with his parents. According to defendant's own testimony he left a bar where he had been drinking about 12:30 a.m. on February 3, 1978, went to his parents' residence and left a note which read:\n\"Mom and Dad, I love you. I just can't get it together. Please forgive...",
