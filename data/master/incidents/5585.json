  "description": "## 사건 정보\n\n**사건명**: State of Tennessee v. Lavern \"Von\" Geanes\n**판결일**: 2010-12-01\n**법원**: Court of Criminal Appeals of Tennessee\n**관할**: Tennessee, TN\n\n**판사**: Judge John Everett Williams\n\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n         IN THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS OF TENNESSEE\n                           AT JACKSON\n                              Assigned on Briefs March 2, 2004\n\n              STATE OF TENNESSEE v. LAVERN “VON” GEANES\n\n                 Direct Appeal from the Circuit Court for Hardeman County\n                         No. 6682B    Jon Kerry Blackwood, Judge\n\n\n\n                      No. W2003-01206-CCA-R3-CD - Filed May 3, 2004\n\n\nA jury convicted the defendant of delivery of 0.5 grams or more of a Schedule II controlled substance\n(cocaine), a Class B felony. He contends that the trial court erred in (1) overruling his Batson\nobjection to the State’s peremptory challenges of two prospective jurors, and (2) overruling his\nobjection to the introduction of the cocaine seized and the subsequent test results based on the State’s\nfailure to properly establish chain of custody. The trial court’s decision to overrule the Batson\nobjection was not clearly erroneous because the State offered reasons for the challenges that do not\ninherently evidence a discriminatory intent. As to the second issue, we conclude that the record does\nnot establish a reasonable assurance of the identity of the evidence. Therefore, we reverse and\nremand for a new trial.\n\n    Tenn. R. App. P. 3 Appeal as of Right; Judgment of the Circuit Court Reversed and\n                                        Remanded\n\nJOHN EVERETT WILLIAMS, J., delivered the opinion of the court, in which DAVID G. HAYES and JOE\nG. RILEY , JJ., join...",
