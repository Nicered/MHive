McDermott., For the contestant, Alan H. Strong and Abraham V. JSchench.\n\n## 인용\n\n- 53 N.J.L. 468\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\nThe opinion of the court was delivered by\nDixon, J.\nThis is an appeal, under section 113 of “An ¡act to regulate elections ” (Rev., p. 337), from the decision of Hie Middlesex County Circuit Court, upon a contest arising over the election of county clerk in November, 1889. The county canvassers had determined that at the election Patrick 'Convery received five thousand nine hundred and forty-nine votes and John H. Conger five thousand nine hundred and thirty-three votes for the office of county clerk, thus electing the former by a plurality of sixteen. In this canvass, out of six hundred and eight votes cast in the First polling precinct &lt;of the Sixth ward of New Brunswick five hundred and five votes were counted for Convery and one hundred for Conger. Before the Circuit Court, Conger insisted that' in that polling place he had received over two hundred legal votes, and that some of them had been fraudulently abstracted and ballots for his opponent fraudulently substituted, so that, according to Hie votes actually cast, he, Conger, was elected. The Circuit ■Court decided in his favor, and ordered that he be' put intis possession of the office. Thereupon Convery appealed under the statute to the Supreme Court, alleging in' his petition seven grounds of error in law committed at the Circuit.\nOf these, the sixth and seventh have already' been adjudicated by this court in Conger v. Convery, 20 Atl. Rep. 166; *470the first and second were not referred to by appellant’s counsel...",
