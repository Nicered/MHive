The appeal was lodged in this court on July 21, 1922.\nThe cause was finally submitted on November 8, 1923. No brief has been filed in behalf of plaintiff in error, and *Page 422 \nno appearance was made to orally argue the cause at the time of its submission. Under rule 9 of this court this appeal may therefore be considered as abandoned.\nHowever, we have examined the record, and find there is sufficient evidence to support the verdict and that the accused in other respects was accorded a fair trial.\nThe judgment of the trial court is therefore affirmed....",
