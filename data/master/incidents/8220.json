Rodriguez, appeals from the judgments of conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of burglary, attempt to commit burglary, larceny and criminal trespass.1 On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) the trial court improperly granted the state’s motion for joinder of six separate cases against him, (2) the court improperly admitted into evidence a tape recording of a 911 call relating to one of the cases, and (3) the evidence failed to support the conviction of one of the counts of burglary. We affirm the judgments of the trial court.\nThe defendant was charged in six separate informa-tions in connection with several residential burglaries that occurred in Bridgeport and Fairfield in June and July, 2002. The court, Damiani, J., granted the state’s motion for joinder of all charges against the defendant in a single jury trial, which then commenced before the court, Hauser, J. After concluding its case-in-chief, the state entered a nolle prosequi as to the charges in the second information.\n*116After the trial concluded, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty on one count of breach of the peace in the second degree and a verdict of guilty on all the remaining counts of burglary, attempt to commit burglary, larceny and criminal trespass. Judge Hauser later granted the defendant’s motion for a judgment of acquittal with respect to one count of burglary in the second degree and entered a finding of guilty of burglary in the third degree....",
