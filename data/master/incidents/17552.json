  "description": "## 사건 정보\n\n**사건명**: Donald M. MALLARD, (Defendant Below) v. STATE of Indiana, (Plaintiff Below)\n**판결일**: 1979-05-30\n**법원**: Indiana Court of Appeals\n**관할**: Indiana, IN\n\n**판사**: Garrard, Hoffman, Staton\n\n## 변호인\n\nHarriette Bailey Conn, Public Defender, Ihor N. Boyko, Deputy Public Defender, Indianapolis, for appellant., Theodore L. Sendak, Atty. Gen., Terry G. Duga, Deputy Atty. Gen., Indianapolis, for appellee.\n\n## 인용\n\n- 390 N.E.2d 218\n- 180 Ind. App. 692\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\nSTATON, Judge.\nAfter jurisdiction over Donald M. Mallard was waived by the juvenile court, he was tried by jury and convicted of first-degree burglary. He was sentenced to a prison term of ten to twenty years. Mallard brings this appeal from the denial of his petition for post-conviction relief, in which he argued that the criminal court lacked jurisdiction to hear his case.\nWe find no error and we affirm.\nTwo persons, an adult and Mallard who was sixteen, were apprehended inside a private home on September 6, 1973. Some money had been taken. At the time, Mallard was on parole from commitment to the Indiana Boys’ School.\nOn September 7, 1973, the juvenile court referee authorized the probation officer to file a delinquency petition; the petition was filed immediately after the authorization. On September 28, 1973, a hearing was held and jurisdiction over Mallard was waived from the juvenile court to the criminal court.\nOn appeal, Mallard raises two issues for our review:\nI. Whether the juvenile court ever acquired jurisdiction of Mallard; and\nII. Whether the waiver order was sufficient to vest jurisdiction in the criminal court.\nI.\nJurisdiction of Juvenile Court\nIndiana law prescribes the procedure by which the juvenile court obtains jurisdiction over a child. Absent transfer from another court, jurisdiction is obtained by the juvenile court only upon the filing of a petition praying that the child be adjudged delinquent.
