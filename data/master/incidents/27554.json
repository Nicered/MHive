This he has wholly failed to do, and his contention is untenable.\nThe second assignment that the evidence is insufficient is, we think, well taken. The evidence on the part of the state is that, under the authority of a search warrant, certain officers went to the residence of defendant, searched his house and found a fruit jar which smelled *Page 6 \nlike it had had whisky in it.
