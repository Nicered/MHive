The trial court\r\nsentenced Johnson to fifteen years' imprisonment.  Johnson now appeals, raising three points of\r\nerror, but a problem with our jurisdiction prevents us from reaching the merits of those issues.  For\r\nthe reasons stated below, we dismiss this case for want of jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n\tThe clerk's record in this case shows that, after the trial court had formally sentenced\r\nJohnson, he executed a document entitled \"Waiver of Motion for New Trial and Right of Appeal.\" \r\nIn this waiver, Johnson acknowledged his right to appeal, but affirmatively (and with his trial\r\ncounsel's permission) waived that right.  Johnson further acknowledged this waiver was made...",
