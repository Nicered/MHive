Spencer Leslie Fleming\n**판결일**: 2014-08-01\n**법원**: Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\n**관할**: USA, Federal\n\n## 변호인\n\nMelvin Alexander Britt, Appellant Pro Se.\n\n## 인용\n\n- 580 F. App'x 217\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\nPER CURIAM:\nMelvin Alexander Britt appeals the district court’s order dismissing his 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2012) complaint under 28 U.S.C. § 1915A(b) (2012). On appeal, we confine our review to the issues raised in the Appellant’s brief. See 4th Cir. R. 34(b). Because Britt’s informal brief does not challenge the basis for the district court’s disposition, Britt has forfeited appellate review of the court’s order. Accordingly, we affirm the district court’s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n...",
