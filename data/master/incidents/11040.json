Because notice of the hearing on the motion was improper, we reverse.\nFacts\nChadderdon sued Blaschke, her former neighbor, for damages allegedly sustained as a result of common law and statutory fraud involving the sale of real estate. Blaschke filed a motion for summary judgment based on the affirmative defense of the statute of frauds, and mailed it to Chadderdon on September 19, 1996. The motion did not state the date it would be heard. A hearing on the motion was later set for November 11, 1996. Blaschke mailed Chadderdon notice of the hearing on October 21, 1996, 21 days before it was set. In her response to the motion for summary judgment, Chadderdon contended notice of the hearing on the motion for summary judgment was untimely, arguing she was entitled to 24-days notice, not 21, because the notice was mailed to her. We presume Chadderdon had less than 21-days notice because she would not have received the notice of submission the same day it was mailed. The trial court overruled Chadder-don’s objection, heard the summary judgment motion as scheduled on November 11, 1996, and granted it. On appeal, Chadder-don challenges the rendition of summary judgment on the basis of inadequate notice.\nNotice\nIn point of error one, Chadderdon complains the court erred by rendering sum*388mary judgment because Blaschke, by mailing the notice of submission 21 days before...",
