Accordingly, we deny Peery’s motion to be excused from paying the filing fee and affirm on the reasoning of the district court. DeBlasio v. Johnson, 128 F.Supp.2d 315 (E.D.Va. 2000). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials be*160fore the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n...",
