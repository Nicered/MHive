The bill was filed on October 26, 1945 for divorce a vinculo on the ground of abandonment on March 20, 1944. The cross-bill (as amended) prayed a divorce a vinculo on the grounds of abandonment on March 25, 1944 and adultery with two named women since the alleged abandonment. In the lower court the case apparently was vigorously contested. In this court, as there was no argument or brief for defendant (appellee), it is practically an uncontested case. It has therefore been *Page 82 \ndeemed necessary that the entire record be read. We concur in the lower court's conclusions as to the facts, but shall add to the statement of facts in the opinion below, in order to indicate the grounds of our decision.\nThe parties were married January 2, 1924. They have a son born October 26, 1928. They lived together peaceably, on plaintiff's farm near Betterton, for about fifteen years. For the last five or six years their peace has been disturbed by (a) defendant's infatuation (evidently imaginary) for a Pennsylvania doctor whom she had once consulted professionally and (b) her repeated accusations against plaintiff of \"running around with women.\" Plaintiff and the son say they were kept awake at night by long discussion of these two subjects. Defendant denies her infatuation for the doctor and, in part, her accusations about women, but plaintiff's testimony is corroborated by the son...",
