  "description": "## 사건 정보\n\n**사건명**: Frank Spalik v. Antonio J. Lona, Jr.\n**판결일**: 1984-02-23\n**법원**: Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York\n**관할**: New York, NY\n\n## 인용\n\n- 99 A.D.2d 918\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\nAppeal from an order of the Supreme Court at Special Term (Smyk, J.), entered March 17,1983 in Broome County, which granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint. Plaintiff and defendants were the three tax assessors of the Town of Windsor, Broome County. For about a year, grave differences arose between plaintiff and defendants, with the result that each faction performed-its functions independently of the other. Practically nothing was done by the board of assessors as a body. One of the duties of the board of assessors was to annually accept requests for and to certify assessment exemptions of taxpayers 65 years of age and older with incomes below a statutory maximum. From a list of prior exempted taxpayers, plaintiff mailed forms to all such taxpayers to be completed and returned. This was done unilaterally with instructions that the forms, when completed, should be returned to the appropriate post-office box in care of F. Spalik, plaintiff herein. Defendants discovered that a number of previously designated eligible exempted taxpayers were noted on the tax rolls without exemption. They, thereafter, caused to be printed in a newspaper of local circulation a notice as follows: “Anyone that filed an aged exemption renewal for partial exemption of County, town, and schoold [sic] taxes in 1980, and mailed them '% Frank Spalik’ please check your tax bill to insure you received your exemption or check with the following Assessors: Wayne McClure 655-1...",
