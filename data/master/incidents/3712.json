LEROY INGRAM v. THE STATE.\n\n      In 2002, Leroy Ingram was convicted of rape and false imprisonment. We\naffirmed his convictions on appeal. Ingram v. State, 280 Ga.

Accordingly, this application is hereby DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.1\n\n\n\n\n      1\n        Ingram complains that although the caption of the trial court’s dismissal order\nis correct, the body of the order refers to him by the wrong name.
