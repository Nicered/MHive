App. 665\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\nEummel, J.*\nThe defendant was charged with the crime of second-degree assault with the intent to rape. The only question before the court is whether a confession obtained by Sergeant Jackson of the Longview Police Department was involuntary because of conduct on the part of Sgt. Jackson which the defendant contends constituted coercion.\nA summation of examples from the United States Supreme Court of what conduct renders a confession inadmissible is set forth in Jackson v. Denno Annot., 12 L. Ed. 2d 1340, 1343, § 4 (1965). It is there stated:\nA confession is not voluntary if it is obtained by any sort of threats or violence, by any direct or implied promises, however slight, or by any exertion of improper influence, such as sympathy falsely induced or the refusal to allow a suspect to telephone his wife until he has confessed. A confession is inadmissible if it is the products of physical intimidation, psychological pressure, a drugged condition, or insanity. Other factors bearing on the voluntariness of a confession are the suspect’s age; his mental powers; the state of his health; his previous experience with the police; the length of his detention; the duration of his interrogation; whether the accused had the advice of a lawyer, friends, or relatives; and whether he was advised of his rights, such as whether or not he was told that he was under arrest, that he might remain silent, that his answers might be used against him, and that he was entitled to counsel.\n(Footnotes ...",
