The jury\n\nrecommended a sentence of 15 years' imprisonment for the robbery conviction,\n\nenhanced to 35 years for the PFO I conviction. Crutcher appeals as a matter of\n\nright, arguing the trial court violated his right to a public trial when it removed\n\nall spectators during the victim's testimony and when it denied Crutcher's\n\nmotion to suppress a photo identification. Having reviewed the record and the\n\narguments of the parties, we affirm the judgment of the trial court...",
