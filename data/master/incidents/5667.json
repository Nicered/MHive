Speedlin, Justice\n                  Rebecca Simmons, Justice\n\nDelivered and Filed: September 1, 2010\n\nAFFIRMED\n\n           In two cases tried together, N.K.M. was adjudicated as having engaged in delinquent conduct\n\nby committing aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and aggravated robbery along with\n\naggravated kidnapping. He was committed to the Texas Youth Commission (TYC) for a 20-year\n\ndeterminate sentence on each case, to be served concurrently. On appeal, N.K.M. argues the\n\ncomplainant’s in-court identification was tainted by a suggestive pretrial identification procedure in\n\none case, and that the evidence of identity was factually insufficient in the other case. We affirm the\n\ntrial court’s judgment in both cases.\n\f                                                                     04-09-00717-CV & 04-09-00718-CV\n\n\n\n                   ...",
