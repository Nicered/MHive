State\n**판결일**: 2009-04-15\n**법원**: Court of Appeals of Texas\n**관할**: Texas, TX\n\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\tNO. 12-08-00088-CR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE COURT OF APPEALS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTWELFTH COURT OF APPEALS DISTRICT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTYLER, TEXAS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAYMOND WINGFIELD,§\r\n\tAPPEAL FROM THE 349TH\r\n\r\nAPPELLANT\r\n\r\n\r\nV.§\r\n\tJUDICIAL DISTRICT COURT OF\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF TEXAS,\r\n\r\nAPPELLEE§\r\n\tANDERSON COUNTY, TEXAS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\r\n\r\n\r\n\tA jury found Appellant Raymond Wingfield guilty on two counts of aggravated assault on\r\na public servant, one count of aggravated assault, and one count of attempted escape.  The jury\r\nassessed his punishment at imprisonment for forty years and a $4,000.00 fine for each of the\r\naggravated assaults on a public servant, and twenty-five years and a $1,000.00 fine for the other two\r\noffenses.  In one issue, Appellant complains that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence\r\nState's Exhibit 36, a weapon alleged to have been used in the assaults.  We affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\nBackground\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe State's evidence shows that Appellant and Dalton Collins attempted to escape from the\r\nEastham Unit of the Texas Department of Corrections.  Collins took the leading role in the attempt,\r\nviciously beating two corrections officers and an inmate who tried to help one of the officers. \r\nCollins's weapon was a makeshift billy club fashioned from a steel pipe plug tied in a prison apron\r\n(State's Exhibit 36).  There is evidence that Appellant never wielded the weapon that fractured the\r\nskulls of the two officers and seriously injured the inmate who tried to intervene.  T...",
