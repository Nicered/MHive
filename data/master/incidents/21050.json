This was the condition of the sidewalk for several days prior to the occurrence. On this record it has not been established that the occurrence resulted from the negligence of the defendant. It does not appear that the defendant failed properly to dear the entire sidewalk; for all that appears it may well be that the patch of ice was caused by casual water or slush tracked onto the sidewalk during the period of slight thaw and subsequently frozen.
