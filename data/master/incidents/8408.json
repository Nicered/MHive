Hounsom, New Smyrna Beach, FL, for Appellant.\nBruce T. Russell, Washington, DC, for Appellee.\n\nORDER\nANTOON, District Judge.\nThis matter is an appeal from the bankruptcy court's Order Denying Debtor's Motion to Reconsider Order of Dismissal. The Debtor, Appellant Susan E. Hounsom (\"Ms. Hounsom\"), appearing pro se here as she did below, contends that the bankruptcy court erred in declining to reconsider its order dismissing her Chapter 13 case on the basis that she is ineligible to be a Chapter 13 debtor.[1] Appellee, the United *321 States of America (\"the Government\"), urges affirmance on the basis of Ms. Hounsom's Chapter 13 ineligibility as well as based on Ms. Hounsom's alleged bad faith in connection with the filing of her Chapter 13 petition. The Court has jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 158(a)(1) and affirms the bankruptcy court's dismissal of Ms. Hounsom's Chapter 13 case due to her ineligibility.\n\nI. Background\nMs. Hounsom filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition on March 5, 2002. In the Schedule E that Ms. Hounsom filed with the bankruptcy court, she listed the IRS among the \"creditors holding unsecured priority claims\" but listed the IRS's claim as \"contingent\" and \"disputed\" and the \"total amount of claim\" as \"0.00.\" (Schedule E, B.R. 7).[...",
