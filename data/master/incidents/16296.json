  "description": "## 사건 정보\n\n**사건명**: KING v. GOSDIN\n**판결일**: 1984-02-17\n**법원**: Court of Appeals of Georgia\n**관할**: Georgia, GA\n\n**판사**: Banke\n\n## 변호인\n\nDaniel K. McCall, for appellant., Fordham E. Huffman, for appellee.\n\n## 인용\n\n- 169 Ga. App. 878\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\nBanke, Judge.\nAppellee Gosdin filed suit against appellant King to recover for injuries allegedly incurred in an automobile collision. King, in turn, filed a third-party action against Derryl Langley. This appeal by King follows the trial court’s order dismissing the third-party complaint based on his failure to respond to a motion by Langley to dismiss the third-party complaint for lack of venue. Held:\n1. Since the order disposes of less than all the claims and does not provide for the entry of a final judgment as to the third-party defendant pursuant to OCGA § 9-11-54 (b) (Code Ann. § 81A-154), and since the procedures for interlocutory appeal have not been followed, the appeal must be dismissed. See D. Davis &amp; Co. v. Plunkett, 119 Ga. App. 453 (167 SE2d 663) (1969); Martin v. Herr, 158 Ga. App. 329 (280 SE2d 387) (1981).\n2. The appellee’s prayer for damages for filing a frivolous appeal is denied. See James v. Seritt, 121 Ga. App. 783 (175 SE2d 163) *879(1970).\nDecided February 17, 1984.\nDaniel K. McCall, for appellant.\nFordham E. Huffman, for appellee.\n\nAppeal dismissed.\n\n\nShulman, P. J., and Pope, J., concur.\n\n...",
