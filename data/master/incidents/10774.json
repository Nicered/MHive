On August 4, 1998, this Court reversed and remanded Johnson's conviction for aggravated assault on Joseph Pratt because we found Johnson's written confession was improperly induced. We specifically found, however, that on the facts presented, Johnson was not entitled to a lesser-included-offense instruction. Johnson v. State, 721 So.2d 650, 655 (Miss.Ct. App.1998) (\"Johnson I\"). Upon return to trial, Johnson again was convicted of aggravated assault and now appeals his conviction, raising the following issues which are stated verbatim from his brief\nI. That a new trial in this matter should have been allowed due to the failure of the Court to allow a lesser included instruction, although requested by the defendant.\nII. During the proceedings the counsel for the Defendant, upon the close of the case in chief of the State of Mississippi, moved for a directed verdict for failure to prove the elements of aggravated assault, and failure to prove corpus delicti due to there having been no pistol or bullet produced. This was overruled.\nFind...",
