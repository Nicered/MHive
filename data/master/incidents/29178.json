  "description": "## 사건 정보\n\n**사건명**: Ex Parte Will Crawford.\n**판결일**: 1910-12-03\n**법원**: Court of Criminal Appeals of Oklahoma\n**관할**: Oklahoma, OK\n\n**판사**: PER CURIAM.\n\n## 변호인\n\nW. A. Huser and W. T. Banks, for petitioner., Fred S. Caldwell and J. C. Wright, for respondent.\n\n## 인용\n\n- 112 P. 41\n- 35 Okla. Crim. 382\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\nWill Crawford, the petitioner, being imprisoned under a judgment of the county court of Okfuskee county for a violation of the prohibition law, has applied to this court for a writ of habeas corpus to the end that he be discharged.\nHis contention is that the county court was without jurisdiction to try him, and that the judgment of conviction rendered against him is void, for the reason that the information upon which the prosecution was based was not verified.\nThis case presents the same question just determined by this court in case No. A-817, Ex parte Tom Talley, 4 Okla. Cr. 398,112 P. 36, and decision in that case is controlling here.\nThe writ of habeas corpus heretofore issued herein will therefore be discharged and the petitioner will be remanded to the custody of the sheriff of Okfuskee county, with directions to execute the judgment of the county court. *Page 383 ...",
