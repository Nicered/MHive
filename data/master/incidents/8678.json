Pen. Code Ann. ' 22.01 (Vernon\r\nSupp. 2004).  Charged by information,\r\nappellant entered a plea of Anot guilty.@  Appellant was convicted and sentenced by a\r\njury to 365 days= confinement in the Harris County Jail and\r\nassessed a fine of $4,000.  In four\r\npoints of error, appellant asserts the evidence was both legally and factually\r\ninsufficient and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at both the\r\nguilt/innocence and punishment phases of his trial.  We affirm. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant=s conviction\r\narises out of an altercation at the C&amp;M Ice House.  The complainant testified that she was at the\r\nbar visiting her friend, the bartender. \r\nAppellant and his fiancee arrived sometime later in the evening.  Appellant was yelling questions about the\r\nmusic selection on the juke box and the complainant replied to these\r\nquestions.  Apparently, complainant=s response angered\r\nappellant and his fiancee. ...",
