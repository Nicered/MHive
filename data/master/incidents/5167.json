See Tex. Penal Code Ann.\n\n§ 22.01(a)(1) (West 2003), § 42.062(a) (West Supp. 2010). The trial court assessed punishment at\n\n180 days in jail and a $100 fine for the conviction for assault with bodily injury and 180 days and\n\na $100 fine for the conviction for interference with an emergency call. Vaughn raises three issues\n\non appeal, asserting that: (1) the trial court erred in denying his request for a self-defense instruction\n\nin the jury charge; (2) the trial court erred in admitting extraneous-offense evidence; and (3) the\n\nevidence is insufficient to support his conviction for interference with an emergency telephone call.\n\nBecause we conclude that the trial court did not err or that any error was harmless, we affirm the trial\n\ncourt’s judgments.\n\f           ...",
