  "description": "## 사건 정보\n\n**사건명**: State of Tennessee v. Corey Forest - Concurring\n**판결일**: 2018-08-27\n**법원**: Court of Criminal Appeals of Tennessee\n**관할**: Tennessee, TN\n\n**판사**: Presiding Judge John Everett Williams\n\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n                                                                                           08/27/2018\n        IN THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS OF TENNESSEE\n                         AT NASHVILLE\n\n                  STATE OF TENNESSEE v. COREY FOREST\n\n                           Circuit Court for Maury County\n                                      No. 24034\n                       ___________________________________\n\n                           No. M2017-01126-CCA-R3-CD\n                       ___________________________________\n\n\nJOHN EVERETT WILLIAMS, P.J., concurring.\n\n       I concur with the majority opinion in this case. I write separately to expand upon\nwhat I feel is the inappropriate procedure employed during this post-conviction\nproceeding. I am unaware of any authority that allows a trial counsel to allege ineffective\nassistance of counsel against himself or herself. Trial counsel in this case had a clear\nconflict of interest. See Frazier v. State, 303 S.W.3d 674, 682-83 (Tenn. 2010) (noting\nthat an attorney in a post-conviction proceeding who had represented the petitioner on\ndirect appeal had a clear conflict of interest); see also Velarde v. United States, 972 F.2d\n826, 827 (7th Cir. 1992) (“[T]rial counsel … can hardly be expected to challenge … his\nown ineffectiveness.”) (quoting United States v. Taglia, 922 F.2d 413, 418 (7th Cir.\n1991)). Attorneys are obligated to avoid ethical violations in their practice of law.\nFrazier, 303 S.W.3d at 683.\n\n        “Attempting to ...",
