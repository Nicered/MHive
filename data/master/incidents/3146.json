FREY v. THE STATE.\n\n      BRANCH, Judge.\n\n       Cory Ray Frey appeals from his conviction of arson, criminal damage to a\n\nresidence and a Jeep, and assault, as well as the denial of his motion for new trial.\n\nFrey contends that the trial court improperly commented on the evidence, that the\n\nState failed to prove criminal damage to the Jeep, and that the court erred by\n\nsentencing him as a recidivist. For the reasons that follow, we reverse Frey’s\n\nconviction of criminal damage to the Jeep but affirm Frey’s remaining convictions.\n\n      “On criminal appeal, appellant is no longer presumed innocent and all of the\n\nevidence is to be viewed in the light most favorable to the jury verdict. This Court\n\ndoes not reconsider evidence or attempt to confirm the accuracy of testimony.\n\nAssessing a witness’s credibility is the responsibility of the factfinder, not this\n\fCourt.” Batten v. State, 295 Ga. 442, 443 (1) (761 SE2d 70) (2014) (citations\n\n...",
