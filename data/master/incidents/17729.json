Saltzman for the defendant., William T. Walsh, Jr., Assistant District Attorney, for the Commonwealth.\n\n## 인용\n\n- 6 Mass. App. Ct. 924\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\nThe defendant has appealed from his conviction for assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon (G. L. c. 265, § 15A). 1. The judge as a matter of discretion may limit or bar the reading of a record of conviction of the defendant (Commonwealth v. Chase, 372 Mass. 736, 750 [1977]; Commonwealth v.

DiMarzo, 364 Mass. 669, 682 (1974) (Hennessey, J., concurring); Commonwealth v. Boyd, 367 Mass. 169, 174 (1975); Commonwealth v. Belmonte, 4 Mass. App. Ct. 506, 511 (1976). The judge gave limiting instructions before the records of conviction were read and again in his charge that were sufficient to avoid any prejudice. Com*925monwealth v. Leno, 374 Mass. at 718-719. As no testimony was introduced beyond the record as to the circumstances of the crime for which the defendant was convicted, Commonwealth v. Callahan, 358 Mass. 808 (1970), and United States v. Plante, 472 F.2d 829, 832, cert. denied, 411 U.S. 950 (1973), are inapposite. 2. The defendant now argues...",
