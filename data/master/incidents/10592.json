Larry Allen Hicks\n**판결일**: 2000-05-19\n**법원**: Court of Criminal Appeals of Tennessee\n**관할**: Tennessee, TN\n\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n           IN THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS OF TENNESSEE\n                            AT KNOXVILLE\n\n               STATE OF TENNESSEE v. LARRY ALLEN HICKS\n\n                Direct Appeal from the Criminal Court for Hamilton County\n                          No. 221717    Douglas A. Meyer, Judge\n\n\n\n\n                            No. E199-00957-CCA-R3-CD - Decided\n                                        May 19, 2000\n\n\n\n\nJUDGE TIPTON dissenting.\n\n\n         I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion=s holding that the roadblock was lawful\nas it related to the defendant.

See Cox v. State, 181 S.W.2d 338, 339 (Tenn. 1944); Robertson v.\nState, 198 S.W.2d 633, 635 (Tenn. 1947) (noting that the authority of THP officers to check for\ndriver licenses is due to the fact that their primary duty is to enforce traffic laws and promote the\nsafety of the traveling public). Thus, the constitutional limitations provided in Delaware v.\nProuse, 440 U.S. 648, 99 S. Ct. 1391 (1979) and State v. Downey, 945 S.W.2d 102 (Tenn. 1997)\ncould logically ...",
