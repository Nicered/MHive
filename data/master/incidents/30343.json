Alexander Parker.\n**판결일**: 1878-01-05\n**법원**: Supreme Court of North Carolina\n**관할**: North Carolina, NC\n\n**판사**: Smith\n\n## 변호인\n\nMr. W. H. Bailey, for plaintiff\"., Mr. J. M. McCorJde, for defendant.\n\n## 인용\n\n- 78 N.C. 128\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\nThe only question         (130) before us is as to the application of the statute to the facts of this case, and whether its operation was suspended during the time the plaintiff remained ignorant of the possession and conversion of the bonds by the defendant, and began to run only at the date of discovery.\nSeveral cases, very briefly reported in 2 N.C. were cited in support of the proposition that the statute ran only from the time when the plaintiff acquired knowledge of the tortious act, and that the defendant was liable; and there have been cases elsewhere in which it is held that in case of fraud the statute runs only from the time of its discovery. The doctrine seems to have been founded on the rule which prevails in a court of equity, and will not permit one who has fraudulently concealed his own wrongful act, and thereby prevented the suit, to set up as a defense the plaintiff's delay in bringing it. But such is not the law in this State. Here it is held, both on principle and authority, that the force and effect given by the statute to the lapse of time cannot be defeated by proof that the plaintiff did not know of the defendant's act of conversion or of his fraud. We will refer to some of our own decided cases:\nIn Hamilton v. Shepherd, 7 N.C. 115, the action was to recover damages for fraud in the sale of a land warrant, to which the defendant pleaded the statute of limitations. The plaintiff replied specially that the fraud was not discovered until within three yea...",
