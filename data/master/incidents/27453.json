Laws, 1910, p. 137. The evidence in this case did not authorize the jury to find that the defendant, with intent to defraud, obtained food and lodging from the boarding-house named in the accusation. Eor the reason that the evi*500dence did not authorize the conviction of the defendant, the court erred in overruling the motion for a new trial.\nDecided June 15, 1926.\nWm. Story, for plaintiff in error. J. H. Gary, solicitor, contra.\n\nJudgment reversed.\n\n\nBroyles, G. J., and Bloodworth, J., concur.\n\n...",
