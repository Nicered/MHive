He appeals the fifteen-year sentence that a sentence-enhancement statute requires the district court to impose when a gun-possessing felon \"has three previous convictions ... for violent felon[ies].\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(1).   He claims that the court should not have counted as \"violent felonies,\" two of his previous Massachusetts convictions for \"assault and battery.\"   Harris makes two arguments, neither of which warrants resentencing.\n    \n    \n      2\n      * The Supreme Court has held that, in determining whether a prior offense is a \"violent felony\" for sentence-enhancement purposes, the sentencing court should \"look only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.\"  Taylor v...",
