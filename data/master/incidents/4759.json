On appeal, Appellant claimed that the trial court erred in denying his motion\r\nto suppress because there was no reasonable suspicion to stop the vehicle in which he was\r\ntraveling.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that there were no specific, articulable\r\nfacts in the record that would support reasonable suspicion for the traffic stop.  The court of\r\nappeals noted that the existence of reasonable suspicion during a traffic stop is a mixed\r\nquestion of law and fact.  The only evidence admitted during the suppression hearing was the\r\narresting officer's offense report.  Because no witnesses testified, the court of appeals\r\nreviewed de novo the question of whether reasonable suspicion existed.  Delafuente v. State,\r\n___ S.W.3d ___, No. 14-11-00500-CR (Tex.
