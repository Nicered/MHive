  "description": "## 사건 정보\n\n**사건명**: CLC Roofing, Inc. v. E.G. Helzer & Mark Thompson\n**판결일**: 2019-07-11\n**법원**: Court of Appeals of Texas\n**관할**: Texas, TX\n\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n                          In the\n                     Court of Appeals\n             Second Appellate District of Texas\n                      at Fort Worth\n                   ___________________________\n                        No. 02-17-00229-CV\n                   ___________________________\n\n          CLC ROOFING, INC., Appellant/Cross-Appellee\n\n                                    V.\n\nE.G. HELZER, Appellee/Cross-Appellant & MARK THOMPSON, Appellee\n\n\n\n                On Appeal from the 342nd District Court\n                        Tarrant County, Texas\n                    Trial Court No. 342-268794-13\n\n\n              Before Sudderth, C.J.; Gabriel and Pittman, JJ.\n                       Opinion by Justice Pittman\n\f                                    OPINION\n\n      The jury found that Appellee Mark Thompson and Appellee and Cross-\n\nAppellant E.G. Helzer (E.G.) committed fraud against Appellant CLC Roofing, Inc.\n\n(CLC). The trial court granted Thompson’s motion for judgment notwithstanding the\n\nverdict (JNOV) and granted E.G.’s motion in part, reducing the jury’s award on the\n\nclaims against him. In its appeal, CLC complains of both the JNOV for Thompson\n\nand the reduction in damages in the final judgment. In his appeal, E.G. challenges the\n\nevidence supporting the jury’s fraud findings against him. Because we hold that the\n\nevidence does not support a fraud finding against either Thompson or E.G., we\n\naffirm the trial court’s JNOV for Thompson and reverse the trial court’s final...",
