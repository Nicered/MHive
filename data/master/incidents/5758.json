McGee, Judge\n\n\n\n\n                  No. E2008-02726-CCA-R3-PC - Filed June 21, 2010\n\n\n\nThe Petitioner, Craig E. Shears, filed a petition for post-conviction relief attacking his\nconviction of first degree murder on the basis of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.\nFollowing an evidentiary hearing, the post-conviction court denied relief based upon its\nfinding that the Petitioner had failed to prove his allegations by clear and convincing\nevidence. In this appeal as of right, the Petitioner contends that trial counsel was ineffective\nin failing to effectively argue a motion to suppress his statement and in preparing for trial.\nThe Petitioner also contends that co-counsel was ineffective in failing to request a\ncontinuance when co-counsel was hired to assist trial counsel. Following our review, we\naffirm the judgment of the post-conviction court.\n\nTenn. R. App. P. 3 Appeal as of Right; Judgment of the Criminal Court is Affirmed.\n\nD.
