  "description": "## 사건 정보\n\n**사건명**: The People of the State of New York v. Joseph Sanford\n**판결일**: 2001-05-29\n**법원**: Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York\n**관할**: New York, NY\n\n## 인용\n\n- 283 A.D.2d 660\n- 725 N.Y.S.2d 870\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\n—Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Queens County (Eng, J.), rendered September 4, 1996, convicting him of attempted murder in the first degree (two counts), criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree, and criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree, upon a jury verdict, and imposing sentence.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the People (see, People v Contes, 60 NY2d 620), we find that it was legally sufficient to establish the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, upon the exercise of our factual review power, we are satisfied that the verdict of guilt was not against the weight of the evidence (see, CPL 470.15 [5]).\nThe sentence imposed was not excessive (see, People v Suitte, 90 AD2d 80).\nThe defendant’s remaining contention is unpreserved for appellate review and, in any event, without merit. O’Brien, J. P., Altman, Luciano and Adams, JJ., concur.\n...",
