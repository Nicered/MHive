  "description": "## 사건 정보\n\n**사건명**: The People of the State of New York v. Curtis Lewis\n**판결일**: 1998-10-26\n**법원**: Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York\n**관할**: New York, NY\n\n## 인용\n\n- 254 A.D.2d 502\n- 682 N.Y.S.2d 213\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\nAppeal by the defendant from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Queens County (Cooperman, J.), rendered June 22, 1995, convicting him of robbery in the first degree (two counts), upon a jury verdict, and imposing sentence.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution (see, People v Contes, 60 NY2d 620), we find that it was legally sufficient to establish the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, upon the exercise of our factual review power, we are satisfied that the verdict of guilt was not against the weight of the evidence (see, CPL 470.15 [5]).\nThe defendant’s sentence was not excessive (see, People v Suitte, 90 AD2d 80).\n*503The defendant’s remaining contention is without merit. Bracken, J. P., Santucci, Krausman and Florio, JJ., concur.\n...",
