Taylor, 451 U. S. 527 (1981), a state prisoner sued under 42 U. S. C. § 1983, claiming that prison officials had negligently deprived him of his property without due process of law. After deciding that § 1983 contains no independent state-of-mind requirement, we concluded that although petitioner had been \"deprived\" of property within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the State's postdeprivation tort remedy provided the process that was due. Petitioner's claim in this case, which also rests on an alleged Fourteenth Amendment \"deprivation\" caused by the negligent conduct of a prison official, leads us to reconsider our statement in Parratt that \"the alleged loss, even though negligently caused, amounted to a deprivation.\" Id., at 536-537. We conclude that the Due Process Clause is simply not implicated by a negligent act of an official causing unintended loss of or injury to life, liberty, or property.\nIn this § 1983 action, petitioner seeks to recover damages for back and ankle injuries allegedly sustained when he fell on a pr...",

We apply this standard and conclude that the District Court in this case did not abuse its discretion when it excluded certain proffered expert testimony.\nI\nRespondent Robert Joiner began work as an electrician in the Water &amp; Light Department of Thomasville, Georgia (City), in 1973. This job required him to work with and around the City’s electrical transformers, which used a mineral-oil-based dielectric fluid as a coolant. Joiner often had to stick his hands and arms into the fluid to make repairs. The fluid would sometimes splash onto him, occasionally getting into his eyes and mouth. In 1983 the City discovered that the fluid in some of the transformers was contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB’s). PCB’s are widely considered to be hazardous to human health. Congress, with limited exceptions, banned the production and sale of PCB’s in 1978. See 90 Stat. 2020, 15 U. S. C. § 2605(e)(2)(A).\nJoiner was diagnosed with small-cell lung cancer in 1991. He1 sued petitioners in Georgia state court the following year. Petitioner Monsanto manufactured PCB’s from 1935 to 1977; petitioners General Electric an...",

In 1996, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), after having expressly disavowed any such authority since its inception, asserted jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products. See 61 Fed. Reg. 44619-45318. The FDA concluded that nicotine is a “drug” within the meaning of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA or Act), 52 Stat. 1040, as amended, 21 U. S. C. § 301 et seq., and that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are “combination products” that deliver nicotine to -the body. 61 Fed. Reg. 44397 (1996). Pursuant to this authority, it promulgated regulations intended to reduce tobacco consumption among children and adolescents. Id., at 44615-44618. The agency believed that, because most tobacco consumers begin their use before reaching the age of 18, curbing tobacco use by minors could substantially reduce the prevalence of addiction in future generations and thus the incidence of tobacco-related death and disease. Id., at 44398-44399.\nRegardless of how serious the problem an administrative agency seeks to address, however, it may not exercise its authority “in a manner that is inconsistent with the administrative structure that Congress enacted into law.” ETSI Pipeline Project v. Missouri, 484 U. S. 495, 517 (1988). And although agencies are generally entitled...",

The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, sitting en banc, held as a matter of federal law that the earlier state court judgments barred the federal antitrust suit. 726 F. 2d 1150 (1984). Under 28 U. S. C. § 1738, a federal court generally is required to consider first the law of the State in which the judgment was rendered to determine its preclusive effect. Because the lower courts did not consider state preclusion law in this case, we reverse and remand.\nI — I\nPetitioners are board-certified orthopaedic surgeons who applied for membership in respondent American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (Academy). Respondent denied the membership applications without providing a hearing or a statement of reasons. In November 1976, petitioner Dr. Treister filed suit in the Circuit Court of Cook County, State of Illinois, alleging that the denial of membership in the Academy violated associational rights protected by Illinois common law. Petitioner Dr. Marrese separately filed a similar action in state court. Neither petitioner alleged a violation of state antitrust law in his state court action; nor did either petitioner contemporaneously file a federal antitrust suit. The Illinois Appellate Court ultimately held that Dr. Treister’s complaint faile...",

Appellant was arrested in Texas and indicted for evading detention in a motor vehicle, a felony offense in violation of TEX. PENAL CODE § 38.04. Appellant's criminal history contained fourteen felony convictions, including drug possession, burglary, theft, escape, and eluding arrest or detention. The state, therefore, charged appellant as a habitual offender. TEX. PENAL CODE § 12.42(d). Approximately two months before trial, the state moved to amend the indictment to include an allegation that appellant had used his truck as a deadly weapon. TEX. PENAL CODE § 12.35(c). The trial court granted the motion. At the close of the state's guilt evidence, appellant moved to dismiss the deadly weapon allegation, but the trial court overruled the *797 motion. The jury convicted appellant of evading detention with a vehicle, found that he had used the vehicle as a deadly weapon, and sentence...",

The University officially recognizes over 100 student groups. It routinely provides University facilities for the meetings of registered organizations. Students pay an activity fee of $41 per semester (1978-1979) to help defray the costs to the University.\nFrom 1973 until 1977 a registered religious group named Cornerstone regularly sought and received permission to conduct its meetings in University facilities.2 In 1977, however, the University informed the group that it could no longer meet in University buildings. The exclusion was based on a regulation, adopted by the Board of Curators in 1972, that prohibits the use of University buildings or grounds “for purposes of religious worship or religious teaching.”3\n*266Eleven University students, all members of Cornerstone, brought suit to challenge the regulation in the Federal District Court for the Western District of Missouri.4 They alleged that the University’s discrimination against religious activity and discussion violated their rights to free exercise of...",

C. §§ 1001 et seg.\nWong Yang Sung, native and citizen of China, was arrested by immigration officials on a charge of being unlawfully in the United States through having overstayed shore leave as one of a shipping crew. A hearing was held before an immigrant inspector who recommended deportation. The Acting Commissioner approved; and the Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed.\nWong Yang Sung then sought release from custody by habeas corpus proceedings in District Court for the District of Columbia, upon the sole ground that the administrative hearing was not conducted in conformity with §§ 5 and 11 of the Administrative Procedure Act.1 *36The Government admitted noncompliance, but asserted that the Act did not apply. The court, after hearing, discharged the writ and remanded the prisoner to custody, holding the Administrative Procedure Act inapplicable to deportation hearings. 80 F. Supp. 235. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 84 U. S. App. D. C. 419, 174 F. 2d 158.

See Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, 79 Stat. 291, as amended, 42 U. S. C. § 1395 et seq. Under the program, providers of health care services can enter into agreements with the Secretary of Health and Human Services pursuant to which they are reimbursed for certain costs associated with the treatment of Medicare beneficiaries. To operate the program, the Secretary issued regulations imposing limits on the amount of repayment based on a range of factors designed to approximate the cost of providing general routine patient service. The question before us is whether the Secretary must afford the six petitioning hospitals an opportunity to establish that they are entitled to reimbursement for costs in excess of such limits.\nI\nA\nA complex statutory and regulatory regime governs reimbursement, rough description of which is necessary back*405ground to this case. To begin, Congress has required the Secretary to repay the lesser of the “reasonable cost” or “customary charg[e].” See 42 U. S. C. § 1395f(b)(l). Rather than attempt to define “reasonable cost” with precision, Congress empowered the Secretary to issue appropriate regulations setting forth the methods to be used in computing such costs. See § ISDSxCvXlXA).1\nPrior to 1972, the Secretary’s regulations contemplated reimbursement of the entirety of a provider’s se...",

After conducting hearings, commissioning surveys, and reviewing extensive public commentary, the Bar determined that several changes to its advertising rules were in order. In late 1990, the Florida Supreme Court adopted the Bar’s proposed amendments with some modifications. The Florida Bar: Petition to Amend the Rules Regulating the Florida Bar— Advertising Issues, 571 So. 2d 451 (Fla. 1990). Two of these amendments are at issue in this case. Rule 4-7.4(b)(l) provides that “[a] lawyer shall not send, or knowingly permit to be sent,... a written communication to a prospective client for the purpose of obtaining professional employment if: (A) the written communication concerns an action for personal injury or wrongful death or otherwise relates to an accident or disaster involving the person to whom the communication is addressed or a relative of that person, unless the accident or disaster occurred more than 30 days prior to the mailing of the communic...",

The union obtained a judgment against him for $275,000. The District Court imposed a constructive trust on Guidry's pension benefits, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed that judgment. Petitioner contends that the constructive trust violates the statutory prohibition on assignment or alienation of pension benefits imposed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 88 Stat. 829, as amended, 29 U. S. C. § 1001 et seq. (1982 ed.)[1]\n\nI\nFrom 1964 to 1981, petitioner Guidry was the chief executive officer of respondent Sheet Metal Workers International Association, Local 9 (Union).

The trial court concluded that a canine sweep is not a search under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution but nonetheless held that the officer's investigation should have ceased upon the defendant's refusal to consent to a search. The Court of Criminal Appeals agreed with the State that, because a canine sweep is not a search under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the defendant's vehicle was legally stopped, the defendant's consent was not necessary, and the officer needed neither probable cause nor reasonable suspicion to conduct the canine sweep.

(Vortt) to recover under quantum meruit for seismic information provided by Vortt to Chevron U.S.A., Inc. (Chevron). The trial court rendered judgment in favor of Vortt. The court of appeals reversed. We reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the cause to that court for the consideration of points which it did not reach.\nThe subject of this dispute is a 160 acre tract of land located in Young County. Both Chevron and Vortt acquired mineral rights to various portions of the tract. In 1978 Vortt contacted Chevron requesting that they enter a farm-out agreement concerning a particular portion of the tract owned by Chevron. Chevron rejected the request to enter a farm-out agreement. Soon thereafter Vortt proposed that the *944two companies enter a joint operating agreement. Chevron informed Vortt that it might be interested in such an arrangement and requested that Vortt submit a proposal. Chevron and Vortt negotiated the specifics of the arrangement until 1983 without reaching an agreement. During this time, they corresponded frequently in an attempt to come to an agreement.\nDuring the negotiations, Vortt provided Chevron with confidential seismic services, graphics, and maps in an attempt to reach a joint operating agreement. After receiving the information, Chevron drilled a producing well at the l...",

A felt hat was also discovered laying on the ground in close proximity to the body.\n\"A subsequent examination of the deceased at the State Crime Lab revealed evidence of its identity and of the probable cau...",

What standard should the trial court apply in determining whether to give instructions on necessarily included offenses? Did the evidence in the present case require instructions on voluntary manslaughter and second degree murder? Should the doctrine of \"invited error\" be invoked where the defense counsel has not articulated a deliberate tactical objection to required instructions?\n\nI.\nAppellant was convicted of first degree murder in the shooting death of her husband, Curt, who died on September 8, 1979. (Pen. Code, *313 §§ 187, 189.)[1] The jury also found that appellant had used a firearm within the meaning of section 12022.5.[2]\nShortly after 1:30 p.m. on September 8th, appellant telephoned the Marin County Communications Center to request emergency...",

State v. Colson, 274 N.C. 295, 163 S.E. 2d 376 (1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1087. However, it must be borne in mind that only unreasonable searches and seizures are prohibited by the Constitution. Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 69 L.Ed. 543, 45 S.Ct. 280 (1925). An unreasonable search has been defined as “an examination or inspection without authority of law of one’s premises or person, with a view to the discovery of . . . some evidence of guilt to be used in the prosecution of a criminal action.” State v. Robbins, 275 N.C. 537, 169 S.E. 2d 858 (1969). The protection against unreasonable searches and seizures is “the security a man relies upon when he places himself or his property within a constitutionally protected area, be it his home or his office, his hotel room or his automobile. There he is protected from unwarranted governmental intrusion.” Hoffa v. United States, 385 U.S. 293, 301, 17 L.Ed. 2d 374, 87 S.Ct. 408 (1966).

Eastroads, L.L.C., and the A. Sullivan Trust (collectively Eastroads) appealed, and the district court affirmed the board's decision. Eastroads then appealed to the Nebraska Court of Appeals, which reversed the judgment of the district court, finding that the decision of the board granting the variance was illegal. The board petitioned for further review, which this court granted.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\nOn April 3, 1995, TCLA, Inc., submitted an area variance request to the board regarding a parcel of land in Omaha, Nebraska, commonly referred to as the \"Thirteenth Street Development.\" The development is zoned \"CC Community Commercial District\" (CC), while the adjacent land to the north and south is zoned \"R 5 Urban Family Residential District\" (R-5). The development is bounded on the east by 13th Street and on the west b...",

Finding that Stemilt's project was inconsistent with the County's interim urban growth area (IUGA) regulation, adopted under the Growth Management Act (GMA), RCW 36.70A, the trial court granted WSA's Land Use Petition Act (LUPA), RCW 36.70C, petition and reversed the County's approval. Stemilt appeals to this court and focuses its claims upon WSA's failure to oppose in a timely fashion the County's earlier decision to rezone Stemilt's property to permit residential development at a certain density.\nWe reverse the trial court. A decision to rezone a specific site is not appealable to a growth management hearings board (GMHB) because site-specific rezones are project permits and hence not development regulations under the GMA.

Taylor (of Fristoe, Taylor &amp; Schultz, Ltd., P.S.), for petitioner.\nJeff Campiche, Prosecuting Attorney, and Jeremy Randolph, Special Appeals Deputy, for respondent.\nROSELLINI, J.\nOnce again this court confronts the difficult task of evaluating the effect that misconduct on the part of a young, zealous prosecutor has upon the rights of the defendant. Here, highly emotional appeals to jury prejudice, as well as improper expressions of personal belief, force us to reverse petitioner's conviction so that petitioner's unconditional right to a fair trial is preserved.\n\nI\nPetitioner, Gordon James Reed, stands convicted of first degree murder for the slaying of his wife. He has never denied committing the act but asserts that extreme intoxication, combined with borderline personality disorders, prevented him from forming a premeditated intent to kill his wife.\nThe basic facts of the crime are relatively undisputed. Petitioner and his wife, Anola Reed, led a seminomadic life for most of the time they were together. One, or both of them, drank frequently and worked less so.

Five months after purchasing the Monte Carlo, Cynthia Hawkins was involved in an automobile accident that virtually demolished the car.\nThe Hawkins were insured by Allstate under a standard automobile liability policy. That policy included a collision provision limiting Allstate’s liability to either paying the actual cash value of the car at the time of the loss or to replacing the car with one of like kind and quality.'\nThe Hawkins reported the accident to Allstate the day it happened, December 6, 1979...",

He pleaded guilty to both charges, reserving the right to appeal the district court's denial of his motion to suppress the marijuana seized during his arrest.  On appeal, defendant asserts that (1) the district court erroneously held that he lacked standing to challenge the stop and search of a car in which he was a passenger, (2) the traffic stop was a pretext to conduct an otherwise illegal search for drugs, and (3) his consent to the search was involuntarily elicited.

The Reese defendants argue, among other things, that several persuasive authorities outside this circuit undermine the contention that the Kuntz plaintiffs2 had standing under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974, 29 U.S.C.

Stevens, Casey's mother's boyfriend, was caring for him at the time Casey sustained the head injury. Stevens was charged with murder in the first degree for killing Casey during the course of committing aggravated battery. Although Stevens claimed that he fell asleep and awoke to find Casey unresponsive on the hardwood floor at the bottom of the stairs in the home, the State argued that Stevens violently shook Casey and slammed Casey's head into the edge of a bathtub causing a massive and fatal head injury.\nStevens's first trial resulted in a mistrial after the jury could not return a verdict. The jury in Stevens's second trial found him guilty. At that trial, both the State and the defense presented expert witnesses to support their theories of the case. One of the S...",

Hatchell, Tyler, for Respondent.\nOWEN, Justice, delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\nSouthwestern Electric Power Company (SWEPCO) brought suit to recover alleged overcharges under long-term coal transportation contracts with Burlington Northern Railroad Company. Two theories of recovery were submitted to the jury. One was based on a contractual provision that addressed \"gross inequity,\" and the second theory was based on unjust enrichment. The jury failed to find gross inequity but answered issues favorably to SWEPCO on unjust enrichment. We agree with the court of appeals that the judgment for SWEPCO based on unjust enrichment cannot be sustained.

We conclude that the refusal to grant a continuance requires vacation of the denials of the motions to suppress.  Thus, under Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(a)(2), we must remand to permit Mejia to withdraw his guilty plea...",

The PELRB held that the Public Employee Bargaining Act, NMSA 1978, §§ 10-7D-1 to -26 (1992, prior to 1997 amendment, effective Apr. 1, 1993) [hereinafter PEBA], requires all public employers, like UNM, to open the collective-bargaining process to all public employees except management employees, supervisors, and confidential employees. The PELRB held UNM's labor policy invalid because it excludes many categories of employees that PEBA includes. The PELRB's determination was affirmed by the district court. On appeal, UNM raises two arguments: (1) that its labor policy is exempt from PEBA under the Act's \"grandfather clause,\" under which public employers whose labor policies were ...",

The plaintiff, Richard Graff, has operated his newsstand there since July 1984, when he purchased the stand for over fifty thousand dollars. This case concerns a City of Chicago municipal ordinance designed to force newsstand operators, such as Graff, to either acquire a permit or face eviction. Chicago threatened to remove Graff from his location. Rather than request a permit, Graff ultimately sought relief in the federal district court, with a facial challenge to the ordinance. The district court denied Graffs request to enjoin Chicago’s proposed enforcement of the ordinance. 800 F.Supp. 576. For the following reasons, we affirm.\nI. Background\nFrom all indications Graffs predecessors had no ownership or property rights to the newsstand. Such newsstands seemed to have operated on public property by sheer acquiescence. At the time Graff purchased the newsstand, Chicago ostensibly required newsstand operators to acquire permits. We say ostensibly, because Graff asserted that then and now newsstands have operated on the public way without permits and only Graff has been targeted for eviction.\nUnder what we shall call the old ordinance, these permits were issued at the discretion of the commissioner of streets and sanitation, and the mayor could revoke a permit at any time. The old ordinance provided that such newsstands co...",

Gen., Nashville, for appellee.\nPermission to Appeal Denied by Supreme Court August 29, 1988.\n\nOPINION\nJONES, Judge.\nThe defendant, Clessie Raymond Buttrey, was convicted of murder second degree by a jury of his peers. The trial court sentenced the defendant to serve a term of fifteen (15) years in the Department of Correction for murder second degree. The trial court also sentenced the defendant to serve an additional five (5) years, consecutive to the principal sentence, because the defendant employed a firearm in the commission of the offense.\nThe defendant appealed as of right to this Court after the trial court denied his motion for a new trial.\nThe defendant has raised two issues for our review. He contends that the evidence contained in the record is insufficient, as a matter of law, to support his conviction for murder second degree; and the sentence imposed by the trial court is excessive.\n\nSUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\nThe defendant argues that the State failed to prove the elements of murder second degree; and, accordingly, this Court should red...",

(Ill. Rev. Stat. 1965, chap. 83, par. 24f.) The new section purports to immunize architects and contractors from liability upon causes of action that do not accrue within four years after the architects or contractors performed their services. On the authority of this section the circuit court of McHenry County dismissed a complaint against an architect, and the plaintiff has appealed directly to this court.\nSummarized, the complaint alleges: John Anderson, hereafter defendant, is a licensed architect who was hired in 1956 by Frank L. Alford to design and supervise the construction of his residence in the village of Lakewood. An ordinance of the village, as well as nationally recognized safety standards, require that ventilation be provided for rooms housing air conditioning machinery.

We therefore reverse those portions\nof the order in which TERC reversed the Board’s valuation\nregarding Krings’ nonagricultural, nonhorticultural property\nand performed such equalization.

Jackson filed suit in North Carolina state court asserting a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress against her former supervisor, Randy Kimel, as well as claims premised on principles of responde-at superior and negligent retention against her former employer, AT &amp; T Technologies Corporation. Jackson contended that Kimel coerced her into having sexual intercourse with him by threatening to withhold assistance with certain work-related problems and by impliedly threatening to terminate her employment.\nAT &amp; T successfully removed the case to federal district court on the ground that Jackson’s claims were preempted by § 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA), 29 U.S.C. § 185 (1988). Finding that Jackson had failed to exhaust the grievance procedures provided in the collective bargaining agreement and that she was unable to satisfy any of the three exceptions to the exhaustion requirement, the district court granted summary judgment to Defendants on all claims.1 Jackson appeals both the removal to federal court and the grant of summary judgment.\nWe conclude that Jackson has failed to proffer sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment on her respondeat superior and negligent retention claims against AT &amp; T.2 We also conclude, however, that Jackson *1321has put forward sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment on her claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress against Ki-mel, an...",

Benton, with whom Mr. Lloyd J. Lawrence was on the brief, for petitioner.\nMr. W.D. Boone for respondents.\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\nThe controversy in this case relates to the liability to local taxation of certain bank deposits made by the petitioner as guardian of an incompetent veteran of the World War. Immunity was claimed under the federal statutes. World War Veterans Act, 1924, § 22,[1] 43 Stat. *246 606, 613, 38 U.S.C. 454; Act of August 12, 1935, § 3 and 5,[2] 49 Stat. 607, 609. The Supreme Court of North Carolina denied the immunity (210 N.C. 352; 186 S.E. 504) and this Court granted a writ of certiorari, January 4, 1937.\nThe controversy was submitted to the state court upon an agreed case. It appeared that petitioner was appointed guardian in May, 1929, and that the veteran then owned no property other than claims against the United States for unpaid compensation and insurance. The tax date in North Carolina for property taxation is April 1st. In 1930 the guardian listed for taxation the property of his ward but the tax paid was refunded under a ruling of the Attorney General of the State, and in consequence no property of the ward was listed and no tax was paid in the subsequent years. In October, 1935, *247 however, the tax ...",

Throughout the trial Cohen's participation in the impersonation scheme was not contested; his theory of defense was duress, that his co-conspirator forced him to cooperate.  On appeal he argues that the lower court erred (1) in refusing to direct a verdict of acquittal on the impersonation count on the ground that the indictment was insufficient to state an offense under the statute; (2) in excluding testimony of out-of-court statements said to be admissible under the state-of-mind exception to the hearsay rule; (3) in refusing to confer immunity to prospective defense witnesses who indicate...",

More than 15 years later Fonner mailed a death threat to Philip Kocis, Commander of the Illinois State Police, who worked with Lackey in 1972.  Fonner also threatened to kill Chief Judge Baker of the Central District of Illinois, who sentenced Fonner in 1982 for threatening President Reagan.

JUSTICE SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\nThis case involves conflicting claims to a tract of 160 acres of land in Imperial County (formerly San Diego County), State of California. The facts, so far as necessary to be stated, are as follows:\nAbout the years 1854-1856 the body of public lands, which includes the tract in controversy, was surveyed under the authority of the United States. No settlements upon these lands of any consequence were made until the year 1900. In the interval the marks of the survey had so far disappeared as to render it practically impossible to locate the lines which the survey had established. None of the section or township corners originally placed upon or in the vicinity of the land here involved was in place, and it was impossible to determine by reference to that survey in what section it was located.\nOn July 1, 1902, Congress provided for a resurvey of this body of public lands, by an act (32 Stat. 728) as follows:\n\"That the Secretary of the Interior be, and he is hereby, authorized to cause to be made a resurvey of the lands in San D...",

Thereafter Officers Gates and Marsden located the premises, a single family dwelling, observed two young female children in front, and ran a utility check which showed that Judy Krivda paid the utilities there. Investigation also showed that Edward Krivda, whose wife was named Judy, had previously been arrested for narcotic activity. About 11 a.m. on July 19, 1968, the officers returned to the address and saw several trash barrels in front on the parkway adjacent to the sidewalk; they also observed the refuse collectors approaching and stopped them about half a block west, identified themselves and requested them to empty the well of their trash truck and pick up the trash in the cans in front of 1901 Nolden.\nThe officers watched the men empty the well of their truck, drive to the front of t...",

C., for plaintiff-appellee.\n\n## 인용\n\n- 591 F.2d 268\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\nGODBOLD, Circuit Judge:\nFrank Cathey was convicted by a jury on three counts of willful attempt to evade or defeat his federal income tax due for the years 1970, 1971 and 1972, in violation of 26 U.S.C. § 7201. He was sentenced to one year imprisonment on each count, the sentences to run concurrently, and a $5,000 fine on each count. The issues raised by Cathey on appeal can be grouped into three categories: (1) government misconduct before the grand jury; (2) Jencks Act material; and (3) introduction of a 16-year-old military conviction for larceny. We find no merit to the claims under the first two headings but conclude that it was prejudicial error to admit the military conviction into evidence. We reverse and remand.\nI. Government misconduct before the grand jury\nA. False statements\nWhile testifying before the grand jury, special agent Derry of the IRS made three statements which defendant says were false, known to the government to be false, and material. Under U. S. v. Basurto, 497 F.2d 781 (CA9, 1974), defendant urges that the government had a constitutional obligation to inform court, counsel and grand jury about the statements and that its failure to do so requires dismissal of the indictment.1\nIn Basurto, the Ninth Circuit held that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment is violated when a defendant has to stand trial on an indictment which the government knows is based partially on perjured testimony, when the perjured testimony is material, and when jeopar...",

Biddix in pro. per.\nBARNHILL, Justice.\nThe hearing commissioner made his award on the stipulations made at the hearing at a time when the claimant was represented by competent counsel. He correctly concluded that the claim for compensation was not filed with the Commission within the time required by law. A majority of the Commission reversed on the ground that the defendants, by their conduct, lulled plaintiff into a sense of security and are now estopped to plead the statute, G.S. § 97-24. To reach this conclusion, they had resort to matters appearing in the files of the Commission which constitute no part of the evidence in the case or the record in the cause. As the court below affirmed, the exceptive assignments of error raise serious questions which, while perhaps not decisive here, should be decided before the concept of the statute and our decisions evidenced by the majority opinion of the Commission becomes too deeply rooted in the administration of the Workmen's Compensation Act.\nThe Industrial Commission is primarily an administrative agency of the State charged with the duty of administering the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Act. As such, it has many ministerial *780 and administrative duties to perform. See Whitted v. Palmer-Bee Co., 228 N.C. 447, concurring op...",

Following a juvenile transfer hearing at which Rodriguez was represented by counsel, the juvenile court ordered that he be transferred to Yuma County Superior Court to be tried as an adult. No appeal from the transfer order was taken.\nIn Superior Court, Rodriguez entered a counseled plea of guilty to second-degree murder and assault with a deadly weapon. He was sentenced to serve a term of not less than 45 nor more than 75 years in Arizona State Prison on the murder count and not less than 5 nor more than 10 years on the assault count. His conviction was upheld on appeal when the Arizona Supreme Court rejected his claim that his guilty plea was not intelligently, knowingly and voluntarily made. State v. Nunez, 109 Ariz. 408, 411-12, 510 P.2d 380, 383-84 (1973).\nAfter exhausting his post-conviction remedies in the Arizona state courts, Rodriguez filed in the United States District Court for Arizona the petition for habeas corpus at issue in this appeal. 28 U.S.C. § 2253 (1982). The petition challenged his conviction and sentence on a number of grounds, including alleged defects in his transfer from juvenile court and ineffective assistance of counsel at his guilty plea, at sentencing and on appeal. He appeals the district court’s dismissal of his petition, inv...",

All of the charges were consolidated for judgment, and the trial court sentenced defendant to a term of twenty-five to thirty-five months' imprisonment and imposed a fine of $15,000. The Court of Appeals, with one judge dissenting, affirmed the trial court. Defendant appealed to this Court as a matter of right based on the dissent below. On 30 December 1998, we also allowe...",

The trial court granted petitioners’ motion for summary judgment. In Cain v. Leake, 695 P.2d 798 (Colo.App.1984), the court of appeals reversed and remanded the case for trial. We granted certiorari, and we now reverse and remand to the court of appeals with directions to reinstate the trial court’s order granting summary judgment.\nI.\nFACTS\nThe tragic sequence of events leading to the accident in this case is undisputed. On the evening of September 9, 1978, Ralph Crowe, eighteen years of age, attended a large, outdoor party of teenagers in Commerce City.1 Over the course of three and one-half hours, Crowe drank eight cups of beer and three cups of alcoholic punch.2 At approximately 11:30 p.m., Commerce City police officers were dispatched to *154break up the party after a neighbor complained. When the officers arrived at the party, they ordered the teenagers to disperse. Ralph Crowe became disruptive and was handcuffed and detained by the officers. Shortly thereafter, the officers were approached by seventeen-year-old Eddie Crowe, Ralph Crowe's younger brother. Eddie Crowe requested that Ralph be released to him and told the officers that he would drive Ralph home.

Although mindful of the difficulties which confront state trial judges in managing busy dockets, especially in the handling of professional witnesses and in the recalcitrance of some counsel, we nevertheless agree with the district court that the denial of a continuance in this case prevented petitioner from presenting his only expert witness on his insanity defense, the sole issue at trial, and deprived petitioner of his right to due process.  The conditional grant of a writ of habeas corpus is affirmed.\n    \n    \n      2\n      Petitioner was prosecuted in state court for breaking and entering a dwelling with intent to commit a felony and involuntary sexual battery.  His only defense at trial was insanity.  The prosecution ...",

Survey in Reeves County. Plaintiffs are the record owners, and defendants claim title under the ten-year statute of limitations. Art. 5510, Vernon's Ann.Civ.Stat. The trial court rendered judgment on the verdict in defendants' favor, and the Court of Civil Appeals affirmed. 446 S.W.2d 37. In our opinion there is no evidence to support the finding of the jury that defendants held adverse possession of the land for ten years.\nIf defendants have title by adverse possession, it must be through use of the land by L. A. Weinacht, hereinafter referred to as Weinacht. His two sons, to whom Weinacht conveyed the disputed tract in 1963, will be referred to by their given names, Charles and Don. The present suit was filed on January 9, 1964. In the summer of 1954, there were changes in the fences so that the land in controversy became part of a different enclosure.

This Court holds that the fact of adultery alone does not disqualify a parent from custodianship but that the polestar consideration in original custody determinations is the best interest and welfare of the minor child.\nThe divorce of Wilbert Marcus Carr, Jr., and Benita W. Carr gives rise to this appeal from the Chancery Court of Washington County. Having found both parents fit parents to have custody of the children, the chancellor found that Mrs. Carr was guilty of adultery and awarded custody to the children's father, Wilbert Carr. Benita W. Carr appeals and assigns the following error:\nThe chancellor erred in finding the parties equally fit to have custody of the children and in granting custody to appellee because appellant had been found guilty of adultery.\n\nI.\nWilbert and Benita Carr were married in January of 1975, and from this marriage two daughters were born, Christen, born in 1976, and Catherine, born in 1978.

We conclude that negligence in the failure to provide an \"adequate safety device\" in the workplace is therefore subject to the comparative negligence defense, assuming that any evidence of the plaintiff's negligence exists. The verdict in favor of the defendants is reversed and the cause remanded for retrial under the principles of comparative negligence. Placek v Sterling Heights, 405 Mich 638; 275 NW2d 511 (...",

We have jurisdiction over the district court's order, affirming the Secretary's decision, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1291.  Because we find that the record cannot justify the ALJ's finding that Jesurum could perform the full range of light work, as defined by the Secretary, we will reverse and remand for further proceedings to determine whether Jesurum is capable of performing work or is capable of engaging in any substantial gainful activity.\n    \n    I.\n    \n      2\n      Jesurum, age 45, is ...",

The Secretary appeals solely to challenge the district court's ruling which allowed a retroactive award of attorneys' fees.

After unsuccessfully appealing his conviction in the Indiana courts, Lord filed this petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2254.  The district court denied Lord's petition.  On appeal, Lord contends that police interrogators violated his right against self-incrimination and his right to obtain the assistance of counsel in two ways:  (1) by continuing their interrogation after he requested counsel, and (2) by eliciting a confession through an illusory promise of leniency.

Following a bench trial, the district court for Douglas County found that Paul F. Peters was justified in setting off $17,620.62 from fees due his former partner, William E. Gast, from a case which Peters had concluded because Gast had underpaid Peters by that same amount in distributing fees collected on another case which Gast had concluded. Upon consideration of Gast's appeal, we find no error and affirm.\n\nBACKGROUND\nThe parties entered into a written partnership agreement effective January 1, 1990, in which they agreed to practice law under the firm name \"Gast &amp; Peters\" (G&amp;P). Under the terms of the agreement, the net profits and losses of the partnership were to be divided and borne equally between the partners.\nIn a November 10, 1992, agreement (merger agreement), Gast and Peters each indicated their acceptance of the outlined terms and conditions of a merger bet...",

There were three categories of counts.  Counts 1-5 were dismissed before trial on the government's motion and no longer concern us.

While one was a six-footer, the other was not so tall. He started toward them to find out what they were doing, but they disappeared in a back alley behind the stores. Hearing a noise in a brick store, he flashed his searchlight around the corner of the building, and saw, on the walk about 24 steps away, a man, who was wearing a short coat and a light hat. Blakely called to the man to come out. The response was a pistol shot. Blakely returned the fire. A fusillade of shots ensued, he firing 7, and his assailant 8. When the shooting was over, another man came out of the store, and both of them hurried to a parked car, 65 yards away, and took off at high speed. As this car went around a curve, Blakely noticed that the right taillight alone was burning. It was a cream or light gray Pontiac.

Does it require a culpable mental state, or is it a \"public welfare offense,\" for which proof of a culpable mental state is not required? We conclude that section 12020(a)(1) is not a public welfare offense, and that the prosecution must prove the possessor's knowledge of the weapon's illegal characteristics.\nWe also conclude that when, as here, the prohibited weapon is a \"short-barreled rifle\" *745  in this case a rifle that had been altered to reduce its overall length to less than 26 inches  the prosecution need only establish the defendant's knowledge of the shortness of the rifle, not its precise dimensions.

J.\nDefendant Tony Lee Allen committed two forcible rapes in 1990. (Pen. Code, § 261, subd. (a)(2).) He pleaded guilty to those offenses and was sentenced to 20 years in state prison. Upon his release from prison in 2001, he was committed to Atascadero State Hospital (Atascadero) under the Sexually Violent Predator Act. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, § 6600 et seq. (SVPA or Act).)[1] This case arises from a proceeding to extend defendant's commitment as a sexually violent predator. At the trial by jury in the underlying proceeding, defendant personally asserted a right and a desire to testify, but his counsel advised the court that for tactical reasons counsel was opposed to defendant's testifying. After informing defendant that counsel controlled this decision, the court agreed it would not be in defendant's interest to testify. For this reason, defendant did not testify. After the jury reached a verdict, the court extended his c...",

CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the court.\nSection 29 of the act to incorporate the St. Louis and Keokuk Railroad Company, approved Feb. 16, 1857, is as follows: \n*734 \"It shall be lawful for the county court of any county in which any part of the route of said railroad may be to subscribe to the stock of said company; and it may invest its funds in the stock of said company, and issue the bonds of said county to raise funds to pay the stock thus subscribed, and to take proper steps to protect the interest and credit of the county. Such county court may appoint an agent to represent the county, vote for it, and receive its dividends.\"\nUnder this authority the County Court of Ralls County subscribed $200,000 to the stock of the company, and, during the years 1870 and 1871, issued bonds of the county to pay the subscription. Default having been made in the payment of coupons for interest attached to some of these bonds, Douglass brought suit against the county, in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Missouri, for their recovery, and, on the 16th of October, 1878, obtained judgment for $17,158.43. That judgment was affirmed in County of Ralls v. Douglass, supra, p. 728.\nAfter the judgment was rendered in the Circuit Court, the present suit was begun by the Unite...",

After trial by jury appellee received a verdict in the amount of $52,529 against appellant city of Fairbanks.[2] We have concluded that the case must be remanded to the superior court for a new trial on the damage issues only.\nBriefly, the evidence showed that just prior to impact appellee was on a motorcycle proceeding south on Cushman Street in the city of Fairbanks at a speed of 20 miles per hour. At this same time defendant Pickens was traveling in an easterly direction along 17th Street with the intent to cross the south-bound lane of Cushman Street in order to make a left turn into the north-bound lane of Cushman.

He appeals from this conviction on several grounds, namely that: (1) the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict; (2) the court erred in allowing a case based solely on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice to go to the jury; (3) the court erred in allowing a State witness to testify against appellant in spite of the State's failure to produce the witness's criminal record; (4) the indictment was insufficient; (5) the State failed to prove the corpus delicti properly; (6) the appellant was required to respond to the prosecution's demand to discover his intention to offer an alibi defense; (7) the prosecutor engaged in misconduct that entitled appellant to a mistrial; (8) an identification of the appellant by one of the witnesses should have been suppressed; and (9) cumulative error.

In one, the Phillips suit, it was alleged that the Exchange had forced sales of futures contracts in March 1970 fresh eggs at artificially depressed market prices and had thereby monopolized and restrained commerce in violation of §§ 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U.S. C. §§ 1, 2, and had violated § 9 (b) of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), as amended, 82 Stat. 33, 7 U.S. C. § 13 (b), by manipulating prices of a commodity for future delivery on a contract market. The Exchange was also accused of violating § 5a of the CEA, 7 U.S. C. § 7a (8), for failure to enforce one of its own rules. In the second suit, the Deaktor case, the Exchange was charged with violating the CEA and its own rules as a designated contract market because it had failed *114 to exercise due care to halt the manipulative conduct of certain of its members who allegedly had cornered the July 1970 market in frozen pork bellies futures contracts.\nThe Exchange defended both actions on the ground that it was faithfully discharging its statutory duty of self-regulation. It asserted that its challenged acts in the Phillips case were measures take...",

Cramer sued Geiselman on the photocopies of two promissory notes payable to a failed bank; the notes were subsequently assigned to Cramer by FDIC acting in its corporate capacity. In five points of error, appellant contends the trial court erred in granting the motion for summary judgment because (1) there are disputed material fact issues concerning ownership of the notes; (2) the affidavits of lost notes of Kathryn G. Pappas are not based upon personal knowledge and are conclusory; (3) the affidavit of Roger Green is not based on personal knowledge and is conclusory; (4) Cramer did not prove it was the holder and owner of the notes; and (5) appellants raised a fact issue as to their affirmative defense of limitations.

A jury convicted him and assessed his punishment at imprisonment for a period of twenty years. Arnwine appeals, contending in a single point of error that the trial court erred in failing to submit to the jury an instruction on the defense of necessity.\nOn the evening in question, at approximately 10:00 p.m., Arnwine, age 41, arrived at his parents' home, where he also resided, and was in the living room when he and his father, Symortis Arnwine,[1] got into an argument. During the argument, the father left the living room and went to a bedroom. After this point, Arnwine's mother's account and his own account of what happened are somewhat conflicting.\nFrancine Arnwine, age 66, testified that after her husband left the room, she also left and went into the kitchen. She further testified that her son followed her into the kitchen, got a plate of food, and returned with his plate to the living roo...",

Although Bennett had clearly stipulated, prior to sentencing, that this sum would be forfeited, and the District Court had entered a preliminary order of forfeiture, Bennett's original sentence did not include a final order of forfeiture. Bennett argues that the District Court lacked the power to order forfeiture after sentencing.\n    \n    \n      2\n      The District Court erred in failing to include a final order of forfeiture in Bennett's sentence, but under the circumstances just described, this was in effect a clerical error.

After judgment was entered in favor of defendant, plaintiff moved to set it aside and to enter a different judgment on the ground that the conclusions of law were erroneous and not consistent with the findings of fact (Code Civ. Proc.,  663(1)). The motion was denied and plaintiff appealed from the judgment *344 and from the order of denial. We granted defendant's motion to dismiss the appeal from the judgment on the ground that notice of appeal had not been timely, but the motion to dismiss the appeal from the order denying plaintiff's motion to vacate the judgment was denied.

He contends that this evidence was obtained by an unreasonable search of his home in violation of the constitutional rights secured to him by the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution and by Article I, Section 15 of the North Carolina Constitution, and he asserts that his wife could not waive his constitutional rights by consenting to a search of their home.\nIt is well settled, in both federal and state courts, that evidence obtained by unreasonable search and seizure is inadmissible.

The trial court found that the complaint did not state a cause of action, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.\nThis Court granted permission to appeal in order to re-examine the parental immunity doctrine, first adopted in this state in McKelvey v. McKelvey, 111 Tenn. 388, 77 S.W. 664 (1903), and most recently reaffirmed in Barranco v.

After a jury trial, appellant was convicted of one count of willful misapplication of bank funds in violation of § 656, one count of making a false entry in the books, reports and statements of the bank in violation of §§ 1005 and 2, and three counts of knowingly making false statements to the bank for the purpose of influencing loan applications in violation of §§ 1014 and 2. A panel of this court affirmed the convictions under §§ 656 and 1014, but reversed the conviction under § 1005. United States v. Adamson, 665 F.2d 649 (5th Cir.1982). Rehearing en banc was granted, and the panel opinion vacated. 665 F.2d 660. Upon rehearing, appellant did not argue that the panel erred when it held that the evidence was sufficient to support convictions on the three § 1014 counts for knowingly making false statements to the bank for the purpose of influencing its action on loan applications; accordingly, Part IV of the panel opinion, sustaining the § 1014 convictions, is reinstated. Similarly, appellant did not *955argue that the panel erred when it rejected appellant’s argument that the district court improperly admitted a certain cease and desist order into evidence; accordingly, Part V of the panel opinion also is reinstated.\nThe only ...",

The man pulled his sleeves down over his hands, wiped down the counter with the sleeves, folded the bills in half, and put the wad of bills in one of his pockets. He then slowly backed away, told the teller not to say anything, and left through the front door.\n    \n    \n      3\n      The bank contacted the police, and the teller described the robber to them as a black male in his early to mid-twenties, between 5'7\" and 5'9\" tall, wearing a gray hooded swea...",

The mental responsibility of the defendant for the crime charged and defendant's mental capacity to give a written confession are the two real issues to be determined on this appeal.\nDuring the trial the prosecution offered the testimony of the prosecutrix and other corroborative evidence, and in the absence of the jury the State offered a written confession of the defendant. The court admitted the confession over the objection of the defendant, and the evidence of the confession was then presented to the jury. The defendant declined to offer proof as to the voluntariness of the confession in the absence of the jury.

Actual and punitive damages of $40,000 and $20,000 respectively were assessed against Sheriff Bosshard, and against Jailer Champion in the amounts of $10,000 and $9,000 respectively.

Upon retirement, each filed a claim pursuant to the Washington Industrial Insurance Act[1] (hereinafter the Act). The Department of Labor and Industries (hereinafter the Department) determined that each worker was permanently partially disabled, and ordered Weyerhaeuser to pay the full cost of each disability. In each case, however, a portion of the employee's hearing loss occurred while the State insured Weyerhaeuser's workers' compensation program, and a portion of the hearing loss occurred after the company became a self-insurer. Weyerhaeuser argues, therefore, that the State should pay a proportionate share of the disability award.\nWe affirm the Department's order and hold that Weyerhaeuser, as the insurer covering the risk during the most recent exposure bearing a causal relationship to the disability, is liable for the entire amount of the award. In so holding, we follow the majority of other states and adopt th...",

Appellant was seen by Beverly Travis, an employee of Ellis, as appellant was driving away from the property with the dolly connected to her truck. Travis notified Ellis and the sheriff's office. Travis, on instructions from Ellis, had told appellant not to use the hay dolly after a prior incident. Appellant admitted taking the dolly for the purpose of transporting hay. Appellant testified that she believed she had permission to do so and claimed she was planning to return the dolly that same day. The hay dolly was in fact recovered the same day.

Because preemption under ERISA and the LMRA was the basis for removal to federal court, the district court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction and remanded the case as required under 28 U.S.C.A.

The third count charged them with carrying on the business of a distiller without having given the bond required by § 3260, Rev. Stats., U.S.C. Title 26, § 284.[1] The fourth charged possession and control of a still not registered as required by § 3258, Rev. Stats., U.S.C.

He found them guilty under both the third and fourth counts and imposed appropriate sentence.\nThe only point presented by the record for our consideration is whether there was adequate evidence to support the conviction.\nThere was enough to show that the petitioners had custody and control of a still for the manufacture of alcoholic spirits, set up and operating, or ready for operation, in a dwelling house.

Kowalski argues that the district court incorrectly granted summary judgment in favor of appellee-employer L &amp; F Products (\"L &amp; F\").   Kowalski has alleged that L &amp; F terminated her for exercising her right to receive certain disability benefits.\n    \n    \n      2\n      We hold that Kowalski has raised a cognizable cause of action under &#167; 510 for retaliatory termination notwithstanding the fact that she had received her benefits prior to being terminated.

Bryant, 562 U.S. ___, 131 S.Ct. 1143, 179 L.Ed.2d 93 (2011), to evaluate whether an out-of-court statement is testimonial. Defendant Harrison Largo's main issues concern the admission into evidence of Victim Freida Smith's out-of-court statements: portions of the 911 tape in which Victim communicated to the 911 operator that Defendant shot her, and a sheriff's deputy's testimony that Victim identified Defendant as her shooter. For the reasons that follow, we affirm Defendant's convictions.\n\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n{2} Defendant and Victim had been in an on-again, off-again relationship for twenty years, during which they had two children. On the morning of May 20, 2008, Defendant, still drunk from the day before, showed up at Victim's trailer. Victim let him inside and Defendant told Victim that he wanted to reconcile their relationship. Victim told Defendant she was not open to reconciliation. The two then went outside the trail...",

Harrell, Asheville, for defendant.\nCOPELAND, Justice.\nDefendant brings forward four assignments of error which he contends require a new trial of this matter. For the reasons stated below, we disagree and find that defendant received a fair trial, free from prejudicial error.\nFirst, defendant argues that the court erred in denying his motion for a continuance. Defendant made this motion on 10 November 1980, the day the case was called for trial. After hearing from both defendant and the State, Judge Kirby granted a continuance of two days, until 12 November 1980. Although defendant excepted to the short duration of this continuance, he did not thereafter raise further objections about it when trial commenced two days later. Nonetheless, defendant now says that the court's allowance of such a short continuance, in which to locate a witness and evaluate the relevance and materiality of his possible testimony, constituted a denial of his right to effective assistance of counsel, as guaranteed by the federal and state constitutions, because his counsel was thereby prevented from conferring with witnesses and preparing an adequate defense.\nIt is, of course, axiomatic that a motion for a continuance is ordinarily addressed to ...",

Defendant was sentenced for the convictions to four years' probation, with the first one hundred days to be served in the county jail. He now appeals, and we affirm.\nOn appeal, defendant argues that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel by counsel's failure to interview and subpoena two alibi witnesses prior to trial, by counsel's failure to move the trial court to adjourn the trial when the alibi witnesses failed to appear at trial, and by counsel's advice to defendant not to testify on his own behalf. We disagree.\nPrior to trial, defendant informed his counsel that two alibi witnesses could testify that he was elsewhere at the time of the crime, giving counsel the names and addresses, and perhaps the telephone numbers, of those witnesses.

He was separately indicted in cause number 99CR0287 for the offense of aggravated kidnapping. Appellant was convicted by a jury of the offenses of robbery and aggravated kidnapping and sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment and assessed a fine of $3,000, and fifty-five years' imprisonment, respectively.\nIn four issues, appellant contends: (1) section 20.04(d) of the Texas Penal Code unconstitutionally placed the burden of proof upon him to show the safe and voluntary release of his victim; (2) the trial court erred in charging the jury and, as a consequence, he was never convicted beyond a reasonable doubt on every element of the offense of aggravated kidnapping; (3) the jury's implicit finding that he failed to voluntarily release his victim in a safe place was manifestly unjust; and (4) the evidence was legally insufficient to support his conviction.

The murder occurred at the Atlanta Penitentiary, where Masters was serving a life sentence for conspiracy to commit murder;1  the victim was a inmate at the penitentiary.  At sentencing, the district judge announced that he was going to depart upwardly from the guideline range, which called for a sentence of 121-151 months imprisonment, and impose a sentence of 240 months because of \"the severity of the offense, a murder and death.\"   Masters' attorney objected to the departure on two grounds.  The first ground was that the court had not given Masters prior notice that it would consider an upward departure at the sentencing hearing.2  The second ground was that the Sentencing Commission had already taken \"a murder and death\" into account in framing the guideline for murder in the second degree, U.S.S.G. 2A1....",

The codefendants received prison sentences and appellant received the death penalty. The conviction was appealed and affirmed by this Court in Averhart, et al. v. State (1984), Ind., 470 N.E.2d 666.\nIn September of 1985, appellant, by counsel, filed a petition for post-conviction relief and a motion for change of judge. Striking resulted in the choosing of the Honorable Vern E. Sheldon as judge to try the post-conviction relief petition. After a long series of amendments and legal maneuvering, the cause came to trial and resulted in a denial of appellant's petition. This is an appeal from that denial.\nThe facts are: On August 11, 1981, at approximately noon, three men robbed the Gary National Bank in Gary, Indiana. The police were informed that a robbery was in progress, and Police Officer George Yaros responded to the call. He was killed in an exchange of gunfire with the robbers as they exited the bank.\nOne of the robbers wore a blue suit. All three robbers opened f...",

All of the defendants except appellee International Bank of Commerce settled before trial. The jury found that appellee's negligence proximately caused the accident and accounted for five percent of the fault causing the occurrence. The jury further found that appellee acted with conscious indifference, but declined to award exemplary damages. The court awarded appellants five percent of their total damages determined in accordance with the jury findings. Appellants contend that the jury's finding included damages for appellee's gross negligence and thereby rendered appellee liable to pay the entire amount of damages it assessed.

The sentences are concurrent.  Count One charged bank robbery, under 18 U.S.C. 2113(a); Count Two charged that, in committing the offense, Short assaulted or put in jeopardy the life of a teller by the use of a dangerous weapon, a handgun, 18 U.S.C. 2113(d).\n      Under our decision in United States v. Faleafine, 9 Cir., 1974, in banc,  492 F.2d 18 (1974), the two counts charged but one offense, the Count One offense, aggravated by the conduct charged in Count Two.  See the cases cited in Faleafine, supra, and United States v. Stroud, 9 Cir., 1973, 474 F.2d 737, 739.  The sentence under Count One is void, and must be vacated.\n    \n    \n      1\n      Short makes but one claim of error that has merit.\n    \n    \n      2\n      Viewed in the light most favorable to the government the facts are as follows: A federally insured b...",

Kirk, Jr., Lubbock, for respondent.\nGREENHILL, Justice.\nThe problem in this juvenile proceeding is the quantum of proof required. The jury found, from a preponderance of the evidence, that George Santana, age 14 at the time of the trial, committed rape upon Frone Mintz and that he was a delinquent child. He was committed to the Texas Youth Council. The contention is that the use of \"the preponderance of the evidence\" is no longer permissible; and that under the Gault decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, the findings must be beyond a reasonable doubt as in criminal cases. In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1, 87 S. Ct. 1428, 18 L. Ed. 2d 527 (1967). The Court of Civil Appeals agreed with the contention. It reversed in the light of Gault. 431 S.W.2d 558. We granted a writ of error to review that holding. A second point, not reached by the Court of Civil Appeals, is whether the State could amend its petition before trial. We must deal with that contention also.\nCounsel for Santana did not object to the wording of the jury issues on the ground that they called for answers based upon a \"preponderan...",

The group of visitors and residents were acquainted with each other. They played cards, rolled dice, and consumed alcoholic beverages. The victim, Johnston's next door neighbor, arrived at Johnston's home between 9:00 and 9:30 p.m. She came over to check if her boyfriend had left a telephone message and to show Johnston a framed poem from him. Upon arrival, the victim was introduced to those present, including defendant.

Before or near the time of death, Spencer also suffered nineteen stab wounds to the pubic region and a vaginal tear that was caused by penetration.

The helicopter was manufactured by Bell Aerospace Corp.  (Manufacturer). Out of the accident arose ten actions which were consolidated for trial in the District Court for the District of Massachusetts.  Three of the ten cases involving the helicopter passengers as plaintiffs, and the Employee as defendant, were voluntarily dismissed by Mrs. Thomas.  One case was discontinued as being duplicative of an existing case.  Another case was dismissed pursuant to stipulation on the eve of trial as a result of a $400,000 settlement between Mrs. Thomas and the Manufacturer.

In short, we are asked to decide whether the mortgage debt's satisfaction under Oklahoma's anti-deficiency statute[2] closes for a defrauded lender all other legal avenues of recovery.

The United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania dismissed the action for fraudulent re-registration of a trademark as time barred, and the remainder of the complaint for lack of standing, failure to state a claim, and pendant jurisdiction.

Wallace, Grove, OK, Representing the Trial Court on appeal.\n\nOPINION\nLILE, J.:\n¶ 1 Frankie Howerton was charged with one count of Owning or Operating a Chop Shop, 63 O.S.Supp.1998, § 4253A, and five counts of Knowingly Concealing Stolen Property, 21 O.S.1991, § 1713, in the District Court of Delaware County, Case No. CF-98-301. Howerton filed a motion to suppress the evidence alleging, generally, that the search of the premises was in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n¶ 2 The Honorable Robert G. Haney, District Judge, ruled that Title 63 O.S.Supp. 1998, § 4209.8 is unconstitutional because its administrative inspection provision violates the 4th Amendment rule against unreasonable searches and seizures. The evidence discovered during the inspection, as well as evidence recovered pursuant to a follow-up search warrant, was suppressed. Subsequently, the Trial Court granted a motion to quash the Information because the State, without the suppressed evidence, had insufficient evidence to proceed.\n¶ 3 The State, taking exception to the Trial Court's ruling, announced its intent to ap...",

Poon argues in this appeal that there was insufficient evidence to show he possessed a firearm during the commission of a felony. We find that even though the testimony of eyewitnesses was in conflict, the evidence was sufficient to convict him on this charge. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.\n\nI.\nThe facts of this case surround a break-in at a residence located in Wilmington, Delaware.

This adverse action was appealed to the MSPB on July 3, 1979, without a claim of discrimination.  On November 6, 1979, the Presiding Official issued his initial decision sustaining Spears' removal.  Spears' petition for review by the full MSPB was denied on November 25, 1980, and no further appeal was taken.\n    \n    \n      3\n      At the time of her removal, Spears had a discrimination complaint pending before Social Security which was filed in October, 1978, an...",

The issue is whether what otherwise would have been a noncustodial interrogation of Wiernasz became custodial, thereby requiring the giving of a Miranda warning, when the police began their questioning by telling Wiernasz about the results of a voluntary polygraph test she had just completed. Specifically, the police indicated that there was a 100% likelihood Wiernasz had been deceptive in responding to a question regarding whether she had done anything to cause her baby to stop breathing. Affirming the trial court's suppression order, the court of appeals concluded that the interrogation was custodial and that police therefore should have given Wiernasz a Miranda warning before questioning her.

The most significant among these are the admission of testimony under the coconspirator exception to the hearsay rule, the government's alleged withholding of evidence from discovery, and the district court's1 granting of a Protective Order foreclosing discovery of technical data of the transmitter used by undercover agents in his arrest.

Sec. 1983 complaint as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1915(d).

We modify and affirm.\n    \n    \n      2\n      Gale is serving a ten-year sentence at the Missouri Department of Corrections for his conviction for sodomy, after which Gale is to serve two concurrent five-year sentences for additional sodomy and rape convictions.\n    \n    \n      3\n      Gale, whose petition for parole was rejected by the Missouri Board of Probation and Parole, filed this section 1983 action seeking a review of the ...",

The Gileses' claims were based on HLM's alleged conduct during its representation of the opposing party in an action the Gileses had initiated which was ultimately settled. On appeal, they contend Arizona law does not prohibit a cause of action for abuse of process against opposing counsel and that the settlement of the underlying action does not necessarily bar a claim for malicious prosecution absent a determination of whether the settlement was favorable to them. Because we find both contentions correct, we vacate the judgment in favor of HLM and remand the matter for further proceedings.\n\nStandard of Review\n¶ 2 A motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 1...",

The codes are a shorthand language used by the insurance industry and the medical profession to describe a condition, treatment or procedure.  By placing a code on a claim form, a doctor tells the insurance company what type of service was rendered by the doctor.\n    \n    \n      3\n      The indictment identified fourteen claims in which patients were hospitalized in the Psychiatric Institute of Fort Worth during 1991 for periods ranging from ten days to six months.

The first question relates to the right to recover in fraud for misrepresentations made subsequent to the execution of a contract for the sale of the residence. The second involves the right of a purchaser to claim a warranty of habitability when the house is constructed by the seller for his own occupancy and the seller is not a professional builder-developer. In granting a summary judgment in favor of the seller the district court held that any false representation could not have been relied upon by the buyers to induce them to purchase the property since any such representations were made after a binding contract to purchase the property was formed. The district court further held that no warranty of habitability attaches to the sale of a home by the builder, if the seller who constructed the home is an amateur builder who is not intending to engage in a commercial venture at the time the home is built. We shall affirm the district court, but in so doing we will hold that in this case the buyers waived ...",

He contends that the State violated its plea agreement in the sentencing recommendation made by the State. Because we conclude that the prosecutor did not honor the plea agreement, we vacate Jones's sentence and remand for resentencing.\n\nI.\n\nBACKGROUND\nAs a result of a beating that Jones inflicted on his wife, he was charged with domestic battery, Idaho Code §§ 18-903, -918, and aggravated assault, I.C. §§ 18-901, -905. Jones entered into a plea agreement by which he agreed to plead guilty to aggravated assault. In return, the State agreed to dismiss the domestic battery charge and to recommend that, upon imposing sentence, the court retain jurisdiction over Jones pursuant to I.C. § 19-2601(4). That statute authorizes a trial court to retain jurisdiction over a criminal defendant for 180 days following sentencing, during which time the defendant will be incarcerated and evaluated by the Department of Correction.

The facts are not in great dispute. Defendant had opened a checking account in The Farmers and Merchants Savings Bank of Ottumwa, Iowa, on or about October 15, 1953, and had made deposits of $430 and one withdrawal *78 of $300 prior to October 23, 1953. On the morning of that date he made a second withdrawal by check made payable to cash of $125, leaving a balance in his account of only $5. Just before closing hours on the same day he deposited to his account a check in the amount of $415 which was dated October 21, 1953, made payable to L. H. Stone, drawn on the Burlington Bank and Trust Company of Burlington, Iowa, and purportedly drawn and signed by one W. H. Barton.

In April 1999, appellant filed an application to be discharged from the state hospital, which the district court denied. Appellant appeals from the district court's order denying his application for discharge and an order denying *588 his declaratory judgment motion, essentially arguing that Wyo. Stat.

Background\nOn the morning of June 18, 1994, the 38th Street Pub in Tacoma was robbed. During the course of the robbery the perpetrator shot and killed Dennis Griswold, the owner of the business. Marshall was charged by the Pierce County prosecutor on June 27, 1994, with the aggravated first degree murder of Dennis Griswold in violation of RCW 9A.32.030(1)(a) and RCW 10.95.020(9).

The Immigration and Naturalization Service denied her application for suspension of deportation because she failed to establish the statutory prerequisite of extreme hardship.  This petition presents two issues for review.  The first is a question of statutory construction: whether the Immigration and Naturalization Service was correct as a matter of law in determining that the hardship to the grandchild was irrelevant to the extreme hardship inquiry conducted under the deportation suspension provision.  8 U.S.C. &#167; 1254(a)(1) (1976).

Williams asked defendant to go with him to pick up some money for his car payment, and Williams then drove defendant to a trailer park in Fairview. Williams parked, got out of the car, went into the trailer park, returned about five minutes later, and motioned to defendant to follow him. Williams went around the end of a trailer while defendant waited at the side. Williams entered the trailer through a window over a television set, breaking an oil lantern that was on top of the TV, and opened the door from the inside, letting defendant in. Then Williams opened a bedroom door and went in, closing the door behind him, leaving defendant in the hallway.\n*652The victim, eighteen-year-old Mary Luanne Odom, who was awake and reading in bed, testified that she heard a crash but thought nothing of it, believing that her mother was awake and in the kitchen. She had resumed her reading when Williams came into her room with a knife in his hand and a nylon scarf over his face. After striking her in the face and knocking her over, the intruder told her not to look, that he was not going to hurt her, and that all he wanted was money. He put his hand over her mouth and asked her who else was at home and where money and valuables were. When she acknowled...",

After reserving her objections to the trial court’s instructions to the jury, defense counsel sought a mistrial on the ground that the prosecutor had injected prejudicial matters not in evidence by making reference to a drug-related, execution-style *777triple murder and to a serial rapist in her closing argument. The Court of Appeals affirmed appellant’s conviction (Bell v. State, 208 Ga. App. 201 (430 SE2d 124) (1993)), and we granted certiorari to consider whether the prosecutor’s references in her closing argument to two well-known, unrelated criminal cases fell within the wide latitude afforded closing argument.\nArgument of counsel is a valuable privilege, and may not be unduly restricted. On the other hand, the court must not allow such latitude as will defeat the justice of the cause, such as introducing prejudicial matters not in evidence. The dignity of the court, and the public interest in having its courts properly conducted, are involved.\nBrooks v. State, 183 Ga. 466, 468 (188 SE 711) (1936). The case at bar was based on a sale of 7.5 grams of uncut heroin that was observed by a surveillance team from the narcotics squad of the Atlanta Police Department. No physical violence or threat thereof was involved, though a defense expert admitted on cross-examination, over appellant’s objection, that he was aware that drugs were a cause of shootings in Atla...",

Garcia, Acting Public Defender of New Jersey, for appellant (Marcia Blum, Assistant Deputy Public Defender, of counsel and on the brief).\nGlenn Berman, Middlesex County Prosecutor, for respondent (Simon Louis Rosenbach, Assistant Prosecutor, of counsel and on the brief).\nBefore Judges HAVEY, BRAITHWAITE and COBURN.\nThe opinion of the court was delivered by HAVEY, P.J.A.D.\nDefendant entered a guilty plea to aggravated manslaughter, N.J.S.A. 2C:11-4c, pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement which called for a twenty-year custodial term, with an eighty-five percent period of parole ineligibility under the No Early Release Act (NERA), N.J.S.A. 2C:43-7.2a. The plea form signed by defendant provided that \"defense counsel agrees not to request a sentence of less than twenty years.\" The trial court imposed a custodial term of eighteen years and found that NERA applied. We hold that the restriction in the plea form deprived defendant of effective assistance of counsel during a critical stage of the criminal proceeding. We therefore reverse and remand for resentencing.\nThe record presented to us reveals that defendant and her ex-husband, Gary Robinson, had an argument in the couple's bedroom after having been out together on New Year's Eve.

The trial court sustained the city's general demurrer without leave to amend, and plaintiff appeals from the ensuing judgment dismissing the action as against the city. We have concluded that under prevailing rules of governmental immunity the city incurred no liability for plaintiff's alleged damages, and that the judgment should be affirmed.\n In the second cause of action plaintiff alleges that on May 4, 1962, the fire department of defendant city was notified of a fire that had started at premises in the city adjoining those of plaintiff; that the department promptly responded with sufficient personnel, equipment and facilities to contain the fire, but because city employees had closed a valve in the water main there was no water in the fire hydrants and consequently the fire spread to plai...",

He was convicted in a jury trial and sentenced to fifteen years' imprisonment and a $5,000.00 fine.\nAlthough factual sufficiency is not raised, we briefly set forth the facts so that the second point of error may be placed in some context. The victim testified that Holmes sexually assaulted her on the afternoon of May 8, 1992, while she was staying at the home of Holmes's estranged wife, the victim's older sister. During the assault Holmes's mother-in-law (the mother of the victim) pulled into the driveway and saw Holmes get up and run away. She testified that there was blood on the victim's shorts. She took the victim to the hospital, and there is medical testimony confirming a sexual assault.\nHolmes first contends that his conviction should be reversed because he was denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial. The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, guarantees the right to a speedy trial. The Texas Constitution gu...",

Opening her eyes, the victim found a male assailant, later identified as Arabie, lying on top of her holding a knife to her chest. Arabie told the victim not to scream because he had a knife and then pressed the serrated edge of the steak knife he was holding to her throat. The victim screamed and tried to squirm away, but Arabie instructed her to do as he said and he would not hurt her.

When the buildings were originally constructed in 1941, separate building permits were issued upon application of defendants' contractor, the permit for the garage building carrying the notation: \"Double Garage--with living quarters--Den and Bath--No kitchen.\" Also \"Zone &amp; yards O.K. Byron 6-20-41.\"\n In 1943, without obtaining a permit therefor, defendants extended the garage unit about 2 1/2 feet and added a kitchen. According to defendants' story the labor incident to this change was performed on a daily wage plus materials basis by a man sent to them by the original contractor, Ed Smith. Defendants were unable to remember this man's name or the amount of money they paid him for the work.\n In July of 1946, defendants sold the property to plaintiff for $13,150, and in August of 1947, plaintiff was notified by the city zoning administrator that the garage unit was being maintained in violation of the city zoning ordinances. ...",

Having carefully reviewed the entire record and each of defendant’s arguments, we find no error in either phase and decline to disturb defendant’s conviction and sentence.\nThe state’s evidence tended to show the following: On 16 August 1986 the body of Jesse Ward, aged seventy-seven, was discovered in the kitchen of his Robeson County home. The victim had spent the previous day helping his brother-in-law, Henry Powell, fix a lawn mower and had planned to return to Powell’s home on the morning of the sixteenth to finish the job. When the victim did not arrive as scheduled, Powell called him on the telephone repeatedly but always received a busy signal. Later that day Powell and his grandson Richard went by the victim’s house. Richard and a neighbor entered the house through the back door and discovered the victim’s body on the kitchen floor. They observed two holes in the victim’s abdomen and blood on his trousers. The victim held the telephone receiver in his left hand, pressed against his ear.\nInvestigators recovered a cartridge casing from the grass near the back door and a spent .22-caliber bullet from the kitchen sink. There were two round holes in the back screen door. An *184autopsy performed by Dr. Marvin Thompson revealed two penetrating gunshot entrance wounds on the victim’s abdomen and a single exit wound on his back. A .22-caliber bullet was lodged in t...",

He then retained present counsel to represent him in this appeal.\nIn this Court the defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to warrant and support the verdict of the jury, insisting specifically that he acted in his own necessary self-defense and that there is no proof of premeditation. The law is well settled in this State, and has been reiterated in numerous cases, that a guilty verdict by the jury, approved by the trial judge, accredits the testimony of the witnesses for the State and resolves all conflicts ...",

Young claimed to receive not merely ineffective assistance of counsel, but no assistance whatever regarding his plea.  Below and on appeal, the state has played procedural football, urging the federal judiciary to punt Young's claims entirely, or at least to lateral them back to the state courts.  We find that the district court properly entertained Young's petition, but that it must retain possession of his claims for further substantive consideration.\n    \n    \n      2\n      The state contends that Young is not \"in custody,\" and thus that the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider his petition.  Second, even if jurisdiction exists, the state urges us to decline jurisdic...",

The offense is a class 4 felony and carries a presumptive sentence of two to four years, plus one year of parole. The maximum sentence which may be imposed is eight years plus one year of parole. Section 18-1-105, C.R.S.1973 (1982 Supp. to 1978 Repl.Vol. 8). The trial court found extraordinary aggravating circumstances and sentenced the defendant to the maximum sentence. The court of appeals, *267 644 P.2d 64, upheld the sentence and we granted certiorari. We affirm.\nThe defendant contends that (1) the trial court erred in considering his prior criminal record in finding extraordinary aggravating circumstances, and (2) the record does not contain sufficient evidence of extraordinary circumstances to warrant an eight year sentence, even if his prior criminal record is relevant.

A.R.S. §§ 13-2308, 13-2311. Whalen raises a number of issues on appeal. He contends that the trial court erred by: (1) denying him the right of self-representation; (2) appointing defense counsel to represent him against his will, who then advanced a defense he neither approved nor authorized; (3) failing to direct a verdict in his favor as to all charges based upon insufficient evidence; and (4) failing to enter a judgment of acquittal or to grant a new trial on the fraudulent scheme charges because insufficient evidence was produced that he had the required fraudulent mental state. Whalen also raises a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. We affirm.\n\nFacts and Procedural History\nWe view the record in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdicts and resolve all inferences against appellant. State v. Atwood, 171 Ariz. 576, 832 P.2d 593 (1992). In April 1995, Whalen was stopped by a Tucson p...",

The jury acquitted defendant on count II, the larceny charge, and on count III, the battery charge. He was found guilty of commercial burglary, a lesser included offense to the charge of aggravated burglary. Defendant appeals from this verdict. We affirm.\nThe issues for decision are: (1) whether the trial court erred in refusing to allow defendant, pursuant to § 41-1-1 C, N.M.S.A. 1978, to recant and revoke statements made by him to a police officer while he was under the care of a physician; and (2) whether substantial evidence supports the burglary conviction. Other issues listed in the docketing statement were not briefed; consequently, on appeal, they are deemed abandoned. State v. Ortiz, 90 N.M. 319, 563 P.2d 113 (Ct.App.1977).\nRevocation of Defendant's Statements\nThe Independent Order of Firefighters was burglarized during the early morning hours of December 18, 1977.

Weisman, Providence, for plaintiff.\nPaula Rosin, Providence, for defendant.\nBefore WEISBERGER, C.J., and LEDERBERG, BOURCIER, FLANDERS and GOLDBERG, JJ.\nOPINION\nGOLDBERG, Justice.\nThe defendant, Angel Suero (Suero), is appealing his convictions for first-degree child-molestation sexual assault, assault with a dangerous weapon, and kidnapping of a minor. The convictions were entered by the Superior Court pursuant to a jury verdict. Suero raises two issues on appeal. First, whether the trial justice erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal, and second, whether the trial justice erred in denying his motion to pass the case. After reviewing the parties' briefs and hearing their arguments, we discern no error. Consequently, we affirm the judgments of conviction and deny Suero's appeal.\nOn the morning of November 16, 1993, at approximately 6:50 a.m., Amy (a fictitious name), the twelve-year-old victim in this case, was walking to her Providence school bus stop when she was approached by an automobile driven by Suero. Amy recognized Suero as an individual whom she had seen previously in front of her house. Suero positioned his vehicle alongside Amy and demanded that she join him. After Amy refused to \"go inside the car,\" Suero exited the vehicle and proceeded on foot toward Amy. Suero then grabbed Amy by her hair, held her at knife ...",

He was tried jointly with a co-defendant, Randall Eugene Cannon, before a jury in Oklahoma County District Court, Case No. CRF-85-3254. Both Appellant and his co-defendant were found guilty on all counts and sentenced to death for the First Degree Murder charge. Both men were also sentenced to terms of 20 years, 100 years, 100 years, 20 years, 15 years, 250 years and 20 years respectively on the other counts. Appellant has filed this appeal seeking reversal of his conviction. We find that we must grant the requested relief insofar as the murder, rape, sodomy and arson convictions are concerned. All other counts, however, are affirmed.\nOn June 24, 1985, Appellant and co-defendant Cannon decided to steal a car after Appellant’s car broke down in a northwest Oklahoma City neighborhood. After selecting a house in the neighborhood, the two men forced their way into the home of eighty-four year old Addie Hawley. They ransacked her home, taking eight dollars from her purse, along with the keys to her car and the garage door opener. The two took her out of the house and into the car. Cannon, who was driving the car, drove for just over a mile before pulling over so that they could put Hawley in the trunk.\nThe two men drove ...",

Mississippi, 410 U.S. 284, 298-303, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 1047-50, 35 L.Ed.2d 297 (1973), holds that states may not use the hearsay rule to deprive defendants in criminal cases of reliable and important evidence--in Chambers, multiple confessions of another person to the murder for which Chambers was on trial.  McDonald told three associates shortly after the shooting that he fired the gun, and he gave a sworn confession to attorneys representing Chambers.  The trial court excluded the statements to the three associates and, by invoking a \"voucher\" rule, made it impossible for Chambers to pierce McDonald's repudiation of his confession to the attorneys.  The Supreme Court held that the state deprived Chambers of due process of law by using archaic rules to foreclose a defense that could have been constructed from reliable evidence.  How reliable must hearsay be to fit the Chambers approach?    We concluded i...",

By three points of error, James contends: (1) the facilities used for his trial proceedings did not conform with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA); (2) the trial court committed error in sentencing James when no proof was adduced proving the trial court had jurisdiction; and (3) the trial court erred in failing to grant a mistrial because the prosecutor injected insinuations of an alleged extraneous offense. We affirm.\n\nI. BACKGROUND\nJames, who has cerebral palsy, was being pulled in a wheelchair by his servant dog in the neighborhood where he lived. The victim, John Doiron, was using a small front loader called a Bobcat, to spread dirt *88 in his front yard. The noise of the Bobcat scared the servant dog, causing it to pull James's wheelchair off course and into a ditch. James's dog ran home. Later, after James collected himself and retrieved his dog, they again passed Doiron's house. The Bobcat scared the dog a second time, and James aga...",

Fox, on February 18, 1948 and John Rotelle on March 19, 1948, both in Montgomery County. Lehman's motion for a severance was denied and over his objection the charges of both indictments were consolidated for trial before the same jury. At the close of the Commonwealth's testimony the trial judge sustained a demurrer to the evidence as to William Meehan, for want of evidence sufficiently identifying him as one of the offenders. Appellant was found guilty, as indicted, on all charges, and was sentenced. New trials were properly refused; the judgments of sentence will be affirmed.\nThere is no merit in appellant's contention that the court is chargeable with abuse of discretion in the consolidation for trial of the charges of the two indictments. The indictments in these cases were closely related in that they charged similar offenses, committed within a month of each other within the s...",

Approximately $1340 was taken during the robbery.\nWalter Toppins, the owner of a service station in Wayne County, some miles from Bluefield, testified that defendants and Moon drove an automobile into his service station in the early morning of the day next following the robbery. The car had a flat tire. The three men had difficulty getting into the trunk to repair the tire because they had no key to the trunk lock, and they bought gasoline but had to pry the locked gas cap off because they had no key to it either.

Based on the drug quantity, William's role in the conspiracy, his acceptance of responsibility, and his criminal history, he was assessed a total offense level of 39 and a criminal history of category VI. The applicable guideline range was therefore 360 months to life imprisonment. The district court1 granted a downward departure for substantial assistance based on the government's motion under U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K1.1 and sentenced Williams to 168 months imprisonment.

The action was begun in 1953, based upon the disallowance by the Treasury of a credit asserted by the plaintiff for taxes paid to the Republic of Cuba for the year 1943.  The facts were as follows.\n    \n    \n      2\n      The plaintiff, which was on an 'accrual' basis as to its U.S. taxes, had issued several series of bonds, bearing interest from five to seven per cent.  In 1940 the Republic of Cuba passed a statute limiting corporations doing business in that country to the payment of one per cent interest upon their bonded debts.  Various of the plaintiff's bondholders refused to recognize the validity of this law as a defense to their claims for full interest, in 1943 one brought an action in the courts of New York and in which he later recovered the stipulated interest.

The trial judge imposed the greatest minimum mandatory sentence of fifteen years with a maximum of life imprisonment on each count, see Utah Code Ann. § 76-3-201(7)(c), and ordered the sentences to run consecutively. Smith argues that the trial court erred (1) in admitting the victim's hearsay statements to a child abuse investigator and police officer under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule and (2) in admitting testimony connecting him to the victim through DNA evidence. In addition, he argues that (3) his counsel was ineffective in failing to engage a DNA expert for the defense and (4) the trial court erred in imposing the greatest minimum sentence for each offense and ordering that the sentences run consecutively.\nOn May 8, 1993, a six-year-old girl was abducted at knife point from her neighborhood in Corinne, Utah, forced into a car, *239 taken to another place, and raped and sodomized.

Crowe, for appellant.\nGlenn Thomas, Jr., District Attorney, James A. Chamberlin, Jr., Assistant District Attorney, for appellee.\nBIRDSONG, Presiding Judge.\nThe sole enumeration of error in this appeal of a burglary conviction is that the trial court erred in sentencing the appellant under OCGA § 17-10-7 (b), which is the statute providing punishment for recidivists. Ronnie Lee Anderson, on July 10, 1978, had pleaded guilty to five accusations charging burglary. Anderson received only one sentence for these five offenses. The single sentence form contains the numbers of all five accusations and sentences Anderson to five years confinement. The form, after listing all five accusation numbers, also states that Anderson entered \"a plea of guilty.\"\nWe have no difficulty in finding these prior offenses were \"consolidated for trial\" and hence constituted one prior conviction under OCGA § 17-10-7 (c); and therefore the trial court erred in sentencing Anderson as a sixth-offense recidivist under § 17-10-7 (b). In Cofer v. Hopper, 233 Ga. 155, 156 (210 SE2d 678), the Supreme Court found that appellant's three prior offenses were \"consolidated for trial,\" under the totality of circumstances including the concurrent run of sentences and the fact that a single probation order was issued for all three separately indicted crimes.

State, 606 P.2d 790 (Alaska 1980). Following a jury trial, Viveros was convicted of armed robbery under former AS 11.15.240 and AS 11.15.295.[1] On appeal the supreme court held that a disjunctive in the jury instructions invalidated Viveros' conviction under AS 11.15.295, leaving stand his conviction for robbery under AS 11.15.240. The state elected not to retry Viveros for armed robbery, and resentencing was required by the supreme court opinion since the 15-year sentence originally imposed could have been affected by the sentence enhancement provision of AS 11.15.295.[2]\nOn resentencing, Viveros received a sentence of 12 years' imprisonment. He claims the sentencing judge, who was also the trial judge, erroneously based this sentence on a belief that Viveros carried a firearm during the robbery. At the resentencing, the judge stated his belief that he could consider the evidence he had heard at trial. Most of his comments show a careful understanding of just what the undisputed ...",

He pleaded not guilty, was tried noncapitally, and was found guilty of all charges. *94 The trial court sentenced defendant to life imprisonment for the first-degree murder conviction, which was based on felony murder. As to the other crimes, pursuant to N.C.G.S. § 15A-1340.4(a)(1)o the court found defendant had a prior conviction or convictions for criminal offenses punishable by more than sixty days' imprisonment. Finding no mitigating factors existed, the court imposed maximum consecutive sentences totalling 170 years. On 26 April 1993, the trial court granted defendant's motion for appropriate relief; arrested judgment on his conviction for first-degree burglary, the predicate for defendant's felony-murder conviction; and made the sentence for first-degree kidnapping consecutive to the life sentence for murder. For reasons which follow, we conclude defendant received a fair trial free of prejudicial error.\nState's evidence tended to show that in the summer of 199...",

Battle joined them for a short time. After he left, the others noticed that a musical compact disk was missing. Believing that Battle had stolen the CD, Haynes and others left the apartment to find him. They located Battle and brought him back to Williams' apartment, where they strip-searched and then beat him. Battle denied taking the CD, and they did not find it on his person. Nevertheless, he was taken outside where Haynes and his friends threw him to the ground and continued to kick and beat him.\n*723 Williams testified that she watched the beating from her front porch and was then told by a friend of Haynes' to go inside because \"they got iron and were fixing to smoke [Battle].\" She observed gunfire fr...",

Loder.\nPER CURIAM.\nRespect for the law is the keystone of our democracy. An attorney by tradition is an appropriate advocate of this truism and it behooves him to act accordingly and to exercise the utmost restraint under all circumstances. This is the theme of the Canons of Professional Ethics, explicitly set forth in the preamble thereto. And Canon 29 provides, inter alia, that the lawyer \"should strive at all times to uphold the honor and to maintain the dignity of the profession and to improve not only the law but the administration of justice\"; in Canon 32 he is admonished \"to observe the statute law\" and advised that he \"will find his highest honor in a deserved reputation for fidelity to public trust and to public duty.\" It is axiomatic that it is extremely desirable that respectability of the bar should be maintained.\nIn the present case the respondent committed assault and battery and subsequently pleaded non vult thereto in criminal proceedings. An attorney's responsibility is to the courts, the profession and the public, and his misconduct may *141 be of such a nature as to engender disrespect for the law which is his basic trust.

The defendant was tried and convicted by a jury and his punishment fixed at 25 years in the penitentiary, and judgment and sentence pronounced accordingly.\nThe defendant's motion for new trial and petition in error sets up numerous assignments of error, but the record discloses all of them to be highly technical and without substance save those covered in defendant's proposition No. 2.

In supplementary proceedings, DaCosta's attorney filed an affidavit and prayed that the court join the appellant as a party defendant, because, as the alleged liability insurer of Cam Exports, Inc., it was obligated for the full amount of plaintiff's judgment, and was therefore a third party holding assets of the judgment debtor. He further prayed for the court to issue its rule nisi directing the appellant to appear and show cause why it should not be required to pay the judgment against Cam Exports, Inc.\nThe court issued its rule nisi, after final judgment, making the appellant a party defendant in the supplementary proceedings, finding that it was or might be l...",

OCGA § 17-10-30(b)(2), (7). On direct appeal from that sentence, we addressed only issues involving Lewis's motion for new trial, reversing the denial of that motion and remanding for another motion for new trial hearing before a different judge. Lewis v. State, 275 Ga. 194, 565 S.E.2d 437 (2002). After that mandated hearing was conducted, the trial court denied Lewis's motion for new trial. Lewis appeals, and we affirm.[1]\n1.

Hillman immediately began to run; appellant, a passenger in the car, exited the vehicle with a knife in his hand and followed Hillman. Witnesses, including Poole and Travis Brooks, who was the driver of the car, testified that within the space of a few minutes appellant chased down Hillman, stabbed him, followed after Hillman as he broke away from the fight, threw Hillman against Poole's car as Hillman tried to enter the vehicle, and stabbed him repeatedly.

An agreement between the parties to a workmen's compensation case duly signed, and approved by the board, is, in the absence of fraud, accident, or mistake, conclusive as to the matters agreed upon, and the approval by the board of the agreement has the same legal effect as an award of the board made after a hearing of the issues. Code § 114-705; Lumbermen's Mutual Casualty Co. v. Cook, 195 Ga. 397 (24 S. E. 2d, 309); Wiley v. Bituminous Casualty Corp., 76 Ga. App. 862 (47 S. E. 2d, 652). Subsequent to the entering of such an order of approval of the agreement, or the entering of an award, the board may entertain a request for modification of the award due to a change of condition. Code § 114-709. By \"change of condition\" is meant a change in the physical condition of the claimant subsequent to the entering of the award, and it has frequently been held that, even where an award is made which erroneously denies compensation, proof by the claimant on rehearing that he is disabled if such disability existed in the same degree and to the *115 same extent at the time of the first hearing, is not sufficient to justify a change in the award based on a change of condition, as the previous h...",

Gabaldon, 92 N.M. 230, 585 P.2d 1352 (Ct.App. 1978), defendant urges (1) that he was denied effective assistance of counsel, and (2) that \"mugshot\" books and a police photo of himself were improperly admitted into evidence.\nIt should be noted that defendant was represented by private counsel at trial and by the Public Defender's Office upon appeal.\nThe basis of defendant's complaint of ineffective counsel rests on his attorney's failure to voir dire the potential jurors, failure to challenge for cause a seated juror when the court was advised by a listed prosecution witness that he recognized the juror as a ...",

Pyfer that he was in pain as a result of a recent injury to his left knee; that his name was Charles Allen, and that he resided at Issaquah, Washington. An examination of the knee did not disclose any injury; however, the doctor did find that it had been previously fused. To alleviate the alleged pain, the doctor prescribed percodan, a narcotic drug. Lee took the prescription to the pharmacy adjacent to the doctor's office, again represented that he was Charles Allen of Issaquah, and asked the pharmacist to request the doctor to prescribe a different drug because percodan made him ill. Dr. Pyfer then substituted the narcotic drug demerol. The prescription was filled, and Lee signed a charge slip as Charles Allen, Issaquah, Washington.\nMarch 6, 1961, Lee returned to Dr. Pyfer's office and obtained a refill of the prescription. Upon this second office call, the doctor recognized him to be Charles Lee, and notified the police.\nAfter Lee left the pharmacy with the demerol, he was arrested. Lee told the arresting officer that the reason he had used a false name and address was that \"... he wanted the demerol and he knew that he c...",

We affirm.\n\nFACTS\n\nPetitioner was indicted on two counts of assault and battery with intent to kill (ABIK) and two counts of resisting arrest under S.C.Code Ann. § 16-9-320(B) (Supp.1998). He was convicted of two counts of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature (ABHAN) and two counts of resisting arrest. He was sentenced to imprisonment for ten years on each count, to be served consecutively. Petitioner’s direct appeal was dismissed pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR. *197State v. Stevenson, Op. No. 95-MO-359 (S.C.Sup.Ct. filed December 7, 1995).\nPetitioner then filed an application for PCR alleging his convictions and sentences for both resisting arrest and ABHAN constitute a violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution and a violation of S.C.Code Ann. § 17-25-50 (1985). Accordingly, petitioner claims trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the dual sentences. During the PCR hearing, trial counsel admitted he never considered whether “resistance of unlawful [sic] authority” was included as an element of ABHAN. The PCR judge denied petitioner’s application finding trial counsel was not ineffective because (1) § 17-25-50 did not apply;1 (2) trial counsel made a motion for a directed verdict based on the ground that a conviction for both ABIK and for resisting arrest vio...",

HEADING,[*] JJ.\nDANHOF, C.J.\nOn May 26, 1976, defendant was found guilty by a jury of manslaughter contrary to MCLA 750.321; MSA 28.553. This conviction arose out of a collision between an automobile driven by the defendant and a second automobile whose *741 driver suffered severe injuries and subsequently died. On July 15, 1976, defendant was sentenced to five years probation. Several probation conditions were imposed including payment within 90 days of $3,000 to the victim's wife, and, additionally, payment of one half of defendant's after-tax income throughout the probation period. Subsequently, the probation order was amended to require that the payments be made to the fiduciary of the victim's estate or, in the alternative, to the wife of the victim. Defendant apparently fulfilled all of the other probation conditions but failed to make any of the payments set out above. On April 11, 1977, following two hearings and a determination by the lower court that the defendant was financially able to make the payments, ...",

Clark appeals his conviction of five counts of sodomy on a child and five counts of sexual abuse of a child. Defendant contends that the trial court erred in excluding evidence of the sexual behavior or, alternatively, the prior false allegations, of his accusers pursuant to Utah's rape shield law. See generally Utah R. Evid. 412(a) (making evidence of a victim's other sexual behavior inadmissable in criminal proceedings involving alleged sexual misconduct). He further argues that the trial court erred in denying an evidentiary hearing on the matter. We affirm.\n\nBACKGROUND\n¶ 2 On June 19, 2006, Defendant was charged with ten counts of sodomy on a child, see Utah Code Ann. § 76-5-403.1 (2008), and five counts of sexual abuse of a child,[1]see id. § 76-5-404.1.[2] The information alleged that Defendant had sodomized and sexually abused his two younger brothers, T.C., then twelve years old, and S.N.C., then ten years old.\n¶ 3 Defendant and his younger brothers resided together with their siblings and parents until 2002, at which point Defendant became estran...",

The trial court denied defendant’s motion to set aside the judgment, and appeal was taken to the Missouri Court of Appeals, Eastern District, which affirmed the trial court’s judgment. This Court granted transfer pursuant to Art. V. § 10, Mo. Const., Rule 83.03 and Rule 83.09.\nThe core issue is a venue-jurisdiction matter and whether the trial court had jurisdiction to enter the default judgment against defendant. Additional issues raised on appeal by defendant are whether the plaintiff proved the elements of his claim and whether the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to set aside the default judgment. We affirm.\nAfter negotiations and representations made by defendant’s salesman, defendant contracted to sell a used crawler tractor to plaintiff. Both plaintiff and defendant, by its salesman, signed the written sales agreement which was executed by both parties in Lincoln County. After a manifold series of mechanical breakdowns resulted in financial losses, plaintiff investigated the causes of the malfunctions. It had been represented to plaintiff at a meeting with defendant’s salesman at the Mexico, Missouri airport in Audrain County that the tractor had never been used commercially but only at a training school, where it had been the subject of students’ disassemblying and reas-semblying parts.

In an opinion published at 565 N.E.2d 375, the Court of Appeals affirmed appellee's conviction.\n*847 On March 8, 1993, appellee filed a \"Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus\" in the Madison Circuit Court where he was incarcerated at the Correctional Industrial Complex. On March 12, 1993, the court granted the petition by finding that appellee was being held on a void judgment of conviction, sentence and commitment order.\nAppellant, in his capacity as Superintendent of the Correctional Industrial Complex, has appealed the Madison Circuit Court's decision to grant the \"Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus.\" Because this appeal involves a question of law of substantial public importance requiring an early determination, this Court took jurisdiction of the appeal from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Ind. Appellate Rule 4(A)(9).\nAppellant contends the Madison Circuit Cour...",

The trial was to a jury which found that the appellant should take nothing on its cause of action for deficiency on the note amount, and made negative findings on appellees' affirmative defense of promissory estoppel and cross-action for fraud. Before submission of the case to the jury, the trial court granted appellees' motion for directed verdict on appellees' claim that the appellant's cause of action for fraud was barred by the statute of limitations.\nThe record reflects that on August 21, 1974, the Walker-Southwest Investment Co., appellee, executed a promissory note and deed of trust to Carruth Mortgage, appellant, in the amount of $2,050,000.00 for certain real property. A guaranty agreement was executed at the same time by Mr. Jaye Ford, appellee. The duration of the note was for one year, to become due on August 20, 1975. When the note became due it was not paid.

Griffith was convicted by a jury of robbery in the first degree, AS 11.41.500. He has appealed that conviction and the resulting sentence. That appeal is pending and is not yet ripe for decision and consequently, it will not be addressed in this opinion. The sole issue before us now concerns Griffith’s challenge to an order denying him bail both pending sentencing and after sentencing pending a determination of his merit appeal. These issues are appealable apart from the appeal on the merits. See AS 12.30.030(b) which provides in relevant part:\nWhen a court denies a motion under (a) of this section [a motion for release from pretrial or post-conviction detention] or conditions of release have been imposed by the court having original jurisdiction over the offense, an appeal may be taken to the court having appellate jurisdiction over the court denying the motion or imposing the conditions subject to the rules of the Supreme Court of Alaska, and the District Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. The order of the lower court shall be affirmed unless it is found that the lower court abused its discretion. If it is held that the lower court did abuse its discretion, the appellate court may modify, vacate, set aside, reverse, remand the action for further proceeding, or remand the action directing entry of the appropriate order, which may include ordering the person to be released under AS 12.30.020(a).

We affirm.\nThe undisputed facts essential to the disposition of this case are as follows: On August 10, 1979, Powell was charged with first degree felony murder, RCW 9A.32.030(1)(c)(5) and first degree kidnapping, RCW 9A.40.020(1)(c). On October 2, 1979, the day of trial, but before a jury was selected, Powell entered a plea of guilty to first degree felony murder. Before sentencing, he moved to withdraw his plea. The motion was denied and Powell appealed. State v. Powell, 29 Wash. App. 163, 627 P.2d 1337 (1981).\nThis court set aside Powell's plea of guilty for the reason that the record did not contain a sufficient factual basis to sustain the plea, and remanded the cause to the superior court for Powell to replead. On July 16, 1981, the cause was mandated to the superior court. Two weeks later Powell was charged by an amended information with premeditated *793 first degree murder, RCW 9A.32.030(1)(a), to which he pleaded not guilty. At a pretrial hearing, Powell moved to dismiss the amended charge on the grounds that (1) h...",

The Juvenile Officer filed a motion to modify, asking the court to find not just that C.L.B. had violated his probation by committing the crime, but to adjudicate C.L.B.'s guilt of the crime. Accordingly, a trial was held, and the juvenile court found C.L.B. guilty of the lesser included offense of stealing from a person. Because C.L.B. was already under the court's supervision, the court applied a \"clear and convincing evidence\" standard of proof in reaching its determination of guilt.\nOn appeal, C.L.B. argues that, because the court below actually adjudicated his guilt of the crime of stealing, rather than merely finding that he had violated his probation by stealing, the court was required to apply the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. He further argues that, under either standard of proof, the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction.\nWe agree with C.L.B. that, because he was not just found to have violated his probation, but was adjudicated...",

Dunham and W.A. Dilbeck executed a promissory note to The First National Bank of Kissimmee. Though only Durham was a Florida resident, both men were present at the Bank when the note was executed. When the note became in default, the Bank filed suit and, acting pursuant to a \"long arm\" statute, Section 48.193, Florida Statutes (1973), served Dilbeck in accordance with Section 48.194, Florida Statutes (1973). Dilbeck moved to quash the service of process upon him and supported the motion with an affidavit stating that he was at all pertinent times a resident of the State of Indiana, so that the trial court did not have jurisdiction over his person. The motion was granted and this appeal followed.\nThe Bank contends that Dilbeck was subject to the jurisdiction on at least one of the following two theories. First, Dilbeck's act of signing the note constituted engaging in a business or a business venture, within the meaning of Section 48.193(1)(a). Second, Dilbeck's failure to repay the note was ...",

Sutton, Las Vegas, for respondent.\n\nOPINION\nZENOFF, Justice.\nIn this appeal we are to determine whether respondent Thompson should be extradited to the state of California to stand trial for the crime of grand theft.\nOn February 26, 1967 Thompson entered into a written contract with Mr. and Mrs. B.W. Williams of Sunnyvale, California, in which Thompson agreed to sell approximately $6,000 worth of rare coins owned by Mr. Williams. Thompson was a guest at the Williams' home in California from February 25 through February 27, 1967. He was then entrusted with the coins and left. About one-half of these coins were subsequently returned.\nOn February 27, 1968 a criminal complaint was filed in the municipal court for the Sunnyvale Judicial District, Santa Clara County, California, charging Thompson with grand theft under California's theft statute which consolidates the offenses of larceny, embezzlement and obtaining money under false pretenses, Cal. Pen. Code § 484 (West 1955).[1] See also Cal.Pen. Code § 490a (West 1955).[2] This *913 was accompanied by a comprehensive affidavit of the investigating detective who swore out the complaint setting forth the facts underlying t...",

He was convicted of rape and aggravated sodomy and brings this appeal.\nOn the evening of March 22, 1985, the victim had a date with *690 Mather Muse and met him at the downtown Holiday Inn lounge. After a couple of drinks, they each drove their car to the Skytop Holiday Inn in Floyd County. They visited the lounge, talked with friends, had a few drinks, and danced until approximately 11:30 p. m., according to the victim and Muse. He walked the victim to her car and asked if she wanted him to follow her home. She said she did not and he departed. He looked back and saw her in her car and waved.\nThe victim said she had difficulty starting the car and was approached by the defendant who asked if she needed any help. She said that she did not, that it usually took a few attempts to get the car started. But the defendant came around to the passenger side, opened the door and displayed an open knife.

The evidence reveals that, from 1987 through 1990, defendant repeatedly sexually assaulted the daughter of the woman with whom he was living. Although the jury found defendant guilty of both charges, the aggravated incest conviction was subsequently overturned by the trial court as a result of newly discovered evidence.\n\nI.\nDefendant contends that § 18-3-405(2)(c), C.R.S.

Three days after Harris filed the report, the sheriff's office began an investigation. Harris was questioned every day for four days and gave the deputy the same story each time he was questioned. Harris continued to work at his regular job, made no effort to flee, and was available for questioning at all times. On the fifth day, a body was found in a well behind Favors' house. It was tentatively identified as Favors, and there was what appeared to be a shotgun wound in the chest. Harris was immediately picked-up and put in jail. He was not told that he was a suspect, nor was he told that he was under arrest, and no warnings of any kind were given to him.

In two points of error he contends the conviction should be reversed because the trial court failed to instruct the jury concerning the parole laws and because the sentence he received is excessive. We overrule these points and affirm the judgment.\nTex.Code Crim.Proc.Ann. art. 37.07, § 4(a) (Vernon Supp.1986) provides that *755 the trial court shall instruct the jury concerning the effect of the parole laws and credit for good conduct allowed inmates while serving in the Texas Department of Corrections. However, Hyde did not object to the court's failure to so instruct the jury. In that circumstance, he is entitled to a reversal only if the failure to instruct was so egregious that he was deprived of a fair and impartial trial. Almanza v. State, 686 S.W.2d 157 (Tex.Crim.App.1984). Hyde has demonstrated no such harm. Indeed, the failure to instruct on the effect of the parole laws would tend to harm the State rather than Hyde, since the instruction effectively advises the jury that a convict may not be required to serve all of the time assessed against him.\nWe...",

He was released in *232 substantial bail and shortly thereafter disappeared. Four years later he was located in Chicago where he was living and working under an assumed name.

His counsel on this appeal did not represent him at the trial.\nThere was substantial evidence to sustain the verdict on each count. Nettleton did not testify, so the jury had no version of the incidents on which the escape charges were based, except that of the state's witnesses which it was entitled to accept. The defense to the rape and burglary charges was an alibi. The jury, obviously, did not believe the alibi witness who was rather effectively impeached.\nFrom the judgments and sentences, the defendant appeals. Two of his contentions merit discussion. It is urged that the trial court should have given an instruction, cautioning *879 the jury in the matter of the weighing of the uncorroborated testimony[1] of accomplices.\n[1] Such an instruction was never requested. Its necessity is urged for the first time on this appeal. This is not such an instruction as a trial judge must give in the absence of a request. It is simply a buttress to the argument that counsel can always make  that an accomplice (particularly one who is not being prosecuted for the offense) need not be believed.

After Calder had a stroke, her relatives, who are Ohioans (and who are the other defendants in the case), deceived her into moving to Ohio, where they had her declared incompetent.

Apparently defendant and Martha had been twice married and divorced and had lived together intermittently at other times. At the time of the events in question, defendant was residing with his parents. According to defendant's own testimony he left a bar where he had been drinking about 12:30 a.m. on February 3, 1978, went to his parents' residence and left a note which read:\n\"Mom and Dad, I love you.

In this appeal, the plaintiffs, Philip and Eileen Pelletier (the Pelletiers), challenge a Superior Court judgment in favor of their neighbor, Aphrodite Laureanno (Laureanno), dismissing the Pelletiers' complaint for injunctive relief and monetary damages. The Pelletiers believed that a written and recorded agreement, entered into by the Pelletiers and Laureanno's predecessor-in-interest, created a permanent easement for parking on a small portion of Laureanno's adjacent property. Laureanno disagreed, and expressed her dissonance in the form of a fence, which served to obstruct the Pelletiers' long-standing parking practice. After a trial on the merits, the trial justice concluded that the written agreement at issue did not grant an easement to the Pelletiers, but instead served merely as a revocable license. On appeal, the Pelletiers ask that we deem this determination to be erroneous.\nThis case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on January 24, 2012, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear ...",

Lewis was convicted of malice murder, felony murder, aggravated battery, burglary, and possession of a knife during the commission of a felony, and he was sentenced to death for the murder. After reversing and remanding for a new hearing on Lewis' motion for new trial, Lewis v. State, 275 Ga. 194, 565 S.E.2d 437 (2002), this Court unanimously affirmed Lewis' convictions and death sentence in 2004. Lewis v. State, 277 Ga. 534, 592 S.E.2d 405 (2004). In that same year, Lewis filed a pro se petition for writ of habeas corpus. After obtaining the assistance of pro bono counsel, Lewis amended his petition in 2007, and an evidentiary hearing was held on March 3 and 4, 2008. In its final order of June 10, 2009, the habeas court found that trial counsel were ineffective at both phases of trial, that appellate counsel was ineffective in failing to raise on direct appeal trial counsel's ineffectiveness, and that Lewis is mentally retarded and, therefore, is ineligible for the death penalty. Accordingly, the habeas court granted habeas relief with respe...",

At the penalty hearing, Appellant elected to proceed with a jury, which determined that he should be sentenced to death on both murder counts. As to both victims, the jury found as aggravating circumstances that the defendant knowingly created a grave risk of death to another person, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(7), and that the defendant has been convicted of another murder, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(11). As to one victim, Michael Love, the jury found a third aggravating circumstance, that the killing was committed by means of torture, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(8). In both cases the jury found that the aggravating circumstances outweighed two mitigating circumstances: the defendant had no significant history of prior criminal convictions, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(1), and he was under the influence of extreme mental and emotional disturbance, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(2).

We awarded a writ of error to the trial court's order sentencing Wynne in accordance with the jury's verdict.\nThe sufficiency of the evidence to convict the defendant is not in question. The defendant testified that he engaged in consensual sexual intercourse with the prosecutrix on the date charged and on four previous occasions. Upon cross-examination, the prosecutrix admitted that she and Wynne had engaged in a single act of consensual sexual intercourse approximately two years before the occasion on which she was forcibly raped by him.\nIn presenting his evidence, the defendant proposed to call four young men who would testify that each of them, on one or more occasions, had engaged in consensual sexual relations with the prosecutrix.

On direct appeal, we reversed the conviction for statutory rape because of a lack of evidence on the essential element of penetration, and affirmed the convictions on the remaining charges. Commonwealth v. Grassmyer, 237 Pa.Super. 394, 352 A.2d 178 (1975).

On August 5, 1977, the court below dismissed appellant's petition. Because appellant's direct appeal counsel was from the same Public Defender's office as his trial counsel, appellant has not waived his claims of ineffectiveness. Commonwealth v.

Near the northeast corporate limits of Des Moines, Primary Highway No. 64 and U. S. Highway No. 6 intersect at a sharp angle. No. 64 extends northeast to Marshalltown from this intersection, and No. 6 extends directly east for about two and one half miles to the town of Altoona, and then generally east over a route with many turns and curves to Colfax, Newton, Grinnell, and points beyond.\nThe land involved in this condemnation proceeding is between the intersection with No. 64 and Altoona, and the land owned by the plaintiffs is just east of the intersection and lies south of, and abuts on, the right of way of No. 6. The defendant procured most of the land needed for the improvement by negotiation and purchase, but plaintiffs refused to sell, and defendant then proceeded by condemnation. Plaintiffs appealed from the award, and that appeal was pending when the injunction was brought and tried.\nIn the late twenties, No. 6 was hardsurfaced with a slab of cement and concrete *683 20 feet in width, with shoulders about 5 feet wide.

Appellant Employers Insurance Company of Nevada (EICON) paid Chandler workers' compensation benefits and eventually closed his claim. After receiving a third-party settlement and reimbursing EICON for benefits paid, Chandler later requested EICON to reopen his workers' compensation claim. EICON denied Chandler's request on the basis that he was required to exhaust the third-party settlement proceeds before it could reopen his claim. EICON's denial was upheld by a hearing officer, but reversed by an appeals officer. The district court subsequently denied EICON's petition for judicial review. On appeal, EICON contends that Chandler is not entitled to receive further workers' compensation benefits, including medical benefits, without first exhausting the entire amount of his third-party settlement...",

Under a federal reimbursement procedure, it sought reimbursement in the amount of approximately $21,000,000 for interest and depreciation expenses incident to the project. Under federal law, detailed studies of need and cost are required at the state level before the reimbursement request will be acted upon. In Iowa, the Department of Public Health is the agency responsible for conducting the necessary feasibility study at the state level. The feasibility study involves a complex system, including a federal-state contract outlining the procedures to be followed, and a maze of studies, polls, hearings and review hearings. In this case it was determined by a review hearing officer that an earlier recommendation disapproving Northwest's proposed move had been affec...",

Appellant raises two points on appeal (a third point was abandoned at oral argument) as follows: (1) the trial court committed reversible error by permitting the prosecuting attorney, over objection, to question defendant as to various previous arrests and criminal charges; (2) the trial court committed reversible error by excluding from evidence testimony as to statements made by appellant and his co-defendant after the alleged crime, which statements related to their knowledge, intent and state of mind at the time of the alleged crime.\nThe events which culminated in the arrest of appellant and his co-defendant, one Covert, began in a Jacksonville Beach bar. There appellant and Covert approached two plain clothes police officers, Barnhill and Maxwell, and offered to sell them drugs. Appellant and Covert testified that they knew the two were police officers and they decided to arrange a fake drug transaction with them \"for the purpose of pulling a prank on them to embarrass them.\" Their conversation with the officers resulted ...",

Thomas was sentenced to five (5) years in the penitentiary, and Cooper and Dollarhide were each sentenced to four (4) years. They appealed to this Court on one record.\nThis cause was submitted to this Court on briefs. Appellants claim the trial court committed reversible error by overruling their motion for a change of venue. It is averred in the motion that due to the popularity of the owner of the property described in the indictments, and to prejudicial pretrial publicity the appellants could not get a fair and impartial trial in Wilcox County. In the record before us there is no evidence in support of appellants' motion. The burden was on the appellants to prove to the reasonable satisfaction of the court that a fair and impartial trial could not be had in Wilcox County. There being in this record no eviden...",

A brief review of defendant's history in court is therefore relevant here. In 1961, Trujillo was tried before a jury and found guilty of two counts of an Information charging him with burglary and assault with intent to commit robbery. The trial judge sentenced defendant to not less than 9½ years and not more than 10 years at the State Penitentiary for the burglary charge, and not less than 13½ nor more than 14 years at the Penitentiary for the crime of assault with intent to commit robbery.

He appeals and we reverse.\n1.

King’s first enumeration of error concerns the allowance of certain testimony which he contends improperly placed his character in evidence. Immediately after opening arguments, King’s attorney made a motion in limine seeking to have the state instruct its first witness, Sandra Collie, not to mention that King had been in jail at some point in time. The state agreed to do so and informed the court that it would also instruct Collie not to mention King’s concerns about his parole eligibility and about having his parole revoked.\nDuring Collie’s testimony, she related a conversation which she had with King on the evening of April 7 wherein King informed Collie that he could not trust Collie “[b]ecause yo...",

Groover, Jr., for appellant.\nC. Wade McGuffey, Jr., Denise L. Dunham, Frederick W. Ajax, Jr., for appellee.\nSOGNIER, Judge.\nTrowbridge Interiors, Inc. (Trowbridge) brought suit against Elrod's Custom Drapery Workshop, Inc. (Elrod's), seeking damages resulting from the rejection by Trowbridge's customers of certain draperies laminated and finished by Elrod's from fabric furnished by Trowbridge, which draperies Trowbridge alleged were defectively constructed by Elrod's. Elrod's filed a third-party complaint against its insurer, the Cincinnati Insurance Company, alleging coverage under a comprehensive general liability (CGL) policy. The insured denied liability because of certain exclusions in the policy, and both it and Elrod's moved for summary judgment. The trial court granted the insurer's motion for summary judgment and denied that of Elrod's, and Elrod's appeals.\nAppellant contends the trial court erred by granting summary judgment to appellee because the exclusions in its CGL policy were ambiguous, thereby creating a question of fact as to whether some, or all, of the claims made upon appellant by Trowbridge were covered. We find this contention, and this case, controlled by this court's decision in Gary L. Shaw Bldrs. v. State Auto. Mut. Ins. Co., 182 Ga. App. 220 (355 SE2d 130) (1987), and cons...",

We affirm.\n    \n    \n      2\n      Because the offense of unarmed robbery was treated as a crime of violence with a statutory maximum of twenty years, Davis's base offense level was 32.

He pleaded not guilty. After jury trial, the defendant was found guilty on both counts. He now appeals and claims, among other things, error in that the trial court violated the single transaction rule by sentencing him on both counts.\nWe affirm the judgment and sentence for sale and the judgment for possession. However, we vacate the sentence for possession.\nThe State concedes that the record at trial reflects that Hines' convictions and sentences arise from the possession and sale of the very same item of narcotics. The effect of the concession is that the offense of possession is a category four lesser-included offense of sale. Anderson v. State, 392 So.2d 328 (Fla. 3d DCA 1981).\n*879 While agreeing that Hines' conviction for possession should be affirmed, we do so only because Hines waived any claim of double jeopardy by failing to raise, in the trial court, the issue of his convictions for the included and ...",

BANKE, Senior Appellate Judge.\nDavid Eric Deal was convicted of kidnapping with bodily injury, aggravated battery and aggravated assault. He enumerates 15 errors on appeal.\nThis case arose during the victim's early morning jog when Deal ran up to her. As she activated her hand-held alarm, he grabbed her and struck her on top of her head with a length of rebar pipe. He continued beating her on her head, shoulders, chest and arms, striking at least 50 blows. Eventually, she fell, and he dragged her into some nearby woods where he started beating her again. The attack lasted approximately 15 minutes, at which point the man fled, leaving the victim bleeding and dazed.\nShortly after her release from the hospital, a police investigator presented the victim with a six-person photographic lineup. The victim immediately picked Deal's brother, Kevin. After the investigator obtained an arrest warrant, he learned that Kevin was in a mental institution and that Deal, who lived in the vicinity of the attack, bore a marked family resemblance to Kevin. When Deal gave inconsistent stories about his actions at the time of the attack, the investigat...",

In these circumstances, the trial judge's instruction that he was guilty of burglary if he had a \"fully formed conscious intent to commit the offense of burglary in [the] structure\" [e.s.], even though unobjected to below, requires a new trial. It is apodictic that the failure to instruct as to any element of an offense which is \"pertinent or material to what the jury must consider in order to convict,\" Stewart v. State, 420 So. 2d 862, 863 (Fla. 1982), amounts to fundamental error which need not be preserved below. Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U.S. 510, 99 S. Ct. 2450, 61 L. Ed. 2d 39 (1979); Viveros v.

Reid, brought this action against the defendants-respondents, Harbison Development Corporation (now Petitioner) and Sam D. Coogler, Builder, Inc., alleging fraud and deceit growing out of a contract whereby the Reids were to *321buy realty. Sam D. Coogler, Builder, Inc., is in bankruptcy and is no longer a party to this proceeding.\nAt trial, the jury found in favor of the Reids actual damages in the amount of twenty thousand ($20,000.00) dollars, plus punitive damages in the amount of twenty-thousand ($20,000.00) dollars. Harbison motioned for a new trial on the grounds that the jury was influenced by caprice and prejudice, and in the alternative, for a new trial nisi “... to reduce the amount of the actual damages award to at least the amount which the plaintiffs themselves testified was their damage under the evidence, which ought to be in the range of $4,000 to $5,000 dollars as indicated by plaintiffs’ own testimony.” The trial judge overruled both motions stating: “Where it may be high, it may be more than would reasonably be expected, I think it is within the range that a jury could return in this case, and that it is not. such that the Court can set aside.”\nHarbison appealed the order of the trial court. The Court of Appeals, in its opinion filed May 6, 1985,1 set aside the twenty thousand ($20,000) dollar actual damages verdict ruling that there was no evidence to substantiate more than five thou...",

Storey, who lived with his mother, was her across-the-hall neighbor. On the day of the murder, a Friday, he had received by mail a divorce petition from his estranged wife. Presumably in response, Storey drank alcohol heavily, and when he ran out of alcohol, he decided to rob Frey in order to purchase more alcohol. Late Friday night or early Saturday morning, he took a knife from his apartment, climbed Frey's balcony, and entered an unlocked sliding glass door. After brutally murdering Frey by beating and inflicting multiple slash...",

State of Alabama.\nBrown was indicted in the Fall of 1960 by a grand jury of Sumter County of the offense of burglary. On or about October 12, 1960, Brown entered a plea of guilty to the offense of burglary in the second degree. Judgment of guilt was duly entered and Brown was sentenced to a term of five years imprisonment in the penitentiary.\nOn July 25, 1963, Brown filed in the Circuit Court of Sumter County a petition for writ of error coram nobis wherein he attacked his conviction and sentence on the ground, among others, that he \"was forced to plead guilty because he did not have the assistance of counsel for his defense.\"\nAfter a hearing at which Brown was represented by counsel, the trial court rendered a judgment denying the relief sought by Brown in his petition for writ of error coram nobis. From that judgment Brown appealed to the Court of Appeals, which court on October 6, 1964, reversed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Sumter County.

Phillips, Sr. The Hendersons allege that Keller, with intent to deceive and induce them to buy the property, failed to disclose that a sunroom heater was defective and that the basement floods when it rains. Later, the Hendersons amended their complaint to allege that, even though asked directly, Keller failed to disclose that the property was on a septic tank.\nSubsequently, Keller moved for summary judgment, contending that the Hendersons were not fraudulently induced to enter into the agreement because no false representations were made, Keller did not know of any defects in the house, Keller had no intention to induce the Hendersons to act, the Hendersons did not justifiably rely on any representations by Keller, and the Hendersons did not incur any damages. Keller also contended they were not liable because the Hendersons bought a vacant, older house, they affirmed the sales contract, and the condition of the property was the result of an act of God.\nAfter the trial court denied Keller's motion for summary jud...",

We affirm the judgment of the habeas corpus court.\nMilford Lee Sanders ran a stop sign on a rainy night, crossed four lanes of highway, and collided with another car. Karen Cain, the passenger in the other car, died as a result of her injuries. A jury found Sanders guilty of failure to stop at a stop sign and first degree vehicular homicide by reckless driving. He was sentenced to ten years in prison and five years probation.\nThe habeas corpus court granted Sanders' petition on a number of grounds, any one of which would have been sufficient to warrant relief. The habeas corpus court first held that relief was appropriate because Sanders lacked a full and fair opportunity to litigate his federal and state constitutional claims with regard to a breathalyser test obtained in violation of his constitutional rights.[1] The habeas court also held that Sanders' Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of *45 counsel was violated in four different ways. In this regard, the habeas corpus court found that Sanders' counsel at trial was ineffective because he (1) failed to submit the proper jury charge on the ...",

He accuses the circuit court of error in proceeding to trial without a jury and without ascertaining whether or not he waived a jury trial voluntarily and knowingly. He also contends that the state's evidence was not sufficient to support the assault and armed criminal action convictions and that the circuit court erred in admitting a laboratory report into evidence. We affirm the circuit court's judgment convicting Bode of assault of a law enforcement officer in the first degree, armed criminal action, and resisting arrest. We, however, reverse the circuit court's judgment convicting Bode of possession of drug paraphernalia with intent to use it and remand for a new trial on that count.\nBode's convictions grew out of an incident on January 25, 2002.

The appellant, Brian Steckel (\"Steckel\") had previously been convicted of murder in the first degree and sentenced to death. His conviction and sentence were affirmed by this Court on direct appeal.[1] Steckel's post-conviction petition was based on a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. The Superior Court ruled that Steckel's counsel was not ineffective for failure to present mitigating evidence in the penalty *652 phase concerning Steckel's narcissistic personality. We agree and affirm.\n\nI\nIn the penalty phase of the trial, Steckel's counsel presented evidence in mitigation relating to Steckel's mental state and personality from two forensic experts, Dr. Stephen Mechanick, a psychiatrist, and Dr. S. Charles Bean, a neurologist. The substance of their testimony was that Steckel had experienced a tragic childhood and was a substance abuser. They opined that Steckel's medical diagnosis was o...",

INTRODUCTION\nBen B. Floyd (the Trustee), the Chapter 11 Trustee for the debtor in the above-referenced Chapter 11 case, Supplement Spot, LLC (the Debtor), brought this adversary proceeding to avoid transfers by *193 the Debtor to Option One Mortgage Corporation (Option One or the Defendant) totaling $90,668.08 under 11 U.S.C. § 548(a)(1)(B) and the Texas Business and Commerce Code § 24.006(a).[1] [Adv. Docket No. 1.] The Trustee argues that the transfers to Option One were fraudulent because: (1) the account from which the funds were transferred (the Amegy Account) was the Debtor's property; (2) the Debtor received less than reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the funds that the Debtor transferred to Option One; and (3) the Debtor was insolvent at the time the transfers were made. The Defendant argues that the Trustee has not met his burden of proof and contends there is insufficient evidence th...",

The trial court entered judgments of conviction and sentenced Cook to life imprisonment on the malice murder count and to consecutive terms of years on the remaining counts. The trial court denied Cook's motion for new trial, and he appeals.[1]\n1. Construed so as to support the verdict, the evidence shows that Cook, along with the victim, Ms. Jennifer Conklin, and Gibby Patrick, went riding in Cook's vehicle while drinking alcohol, and that the victim passed out for a time. Eventually, Cook dropped Patrick off and drove to an isolated area. According to the testimony of Cook's former cellmate, Timothy Powell, Cook stated that the victim passed out again and that he then engaged in anal intercourse with her. When she awoke and screamed, he grabbed her by the mouth while he continued to sexually assault her. Realizing that he had smothered her and believing that she was dead, Cook placed her body in some woods in Coweta County and later returned to b...",

For reasons discussed below, we affirm.\n1. In three enumerations, Hudson challenges the sufficiency of the evidence presented at trial. However, Hudson has failed to include a statement of facts in his brief, as required by Court of Appeals Rule 27(a)(1), and has failed to cite to, or even mention, any facts in the argument section of his brief, as required by Court of Appeals Rule 27(c)(3). As we have reiterated time and time again, this Court will not cull the record in search of error on behalf of a party.[1] Because Hudson has not supported these enumerations with appropriate citations to the record or to authority, they are deemed abandoned.[2]\n2. Hudson contends that the trial court erred in giving a recharge on recent possession. His one-sentence \"argument\" states that \"[t]he repetition of the recent possession charge alone and out of the context of the remainder of the charge served to over emphasize that principle and negate the application of the other legal theories described in the charge.\" However, Hudson does not provide any record...",

Att'y Gen., Salt Lake City, for plaintiff.\nLori Seppi, Heidi Buchi, Salt Lake City, for defendant.\n\nOn Certiorari to the Utah Court of Appeals\nDURHAM, Chief Justice:\n¶ 1 Defendant Alex Montiel appealed his conviction for aggravated robbery, arguing that the trial court abused its discretion in rejecting a pretrial plea agreement based on a stated policy of rejecting pleas that waive penalty enhancements for use of a firearm. The court of appeals affirmed Montiel's conviction. We granted certiorari to consider the scope of judicial discretion vis-à-vis plea agreements. We hold that trial courts retain broadthough not unlimiteddiscretion in accepting or rejecting plea agreements, and that, under the circumstances of this case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion. We therefore affirm the court of appeals.\n\nBACKGROUND\n¶ 2 Montiel was charged with aggravated robbery, a first-degree felony, in violation of Utah Code section 76-6-302. If convicted, Montiel was also subject to an enhanced penalty pursuant to Utah Code section 76-3-203.1 because the crime was committed in concert with two or more persons. Under Utah Code section 76-3-203,[1] Montiel was arguably subject to a further enhanced penalty for use of ...",

From the judgment entered on the verdict, this appeal was taken.\nAbout 6 o'clock P.M. on May 6, 1950, a party went to the home of the police judge in Burley, Idaho, and asked that a criminal complaint be filed against Mrs. Anderson for assault and battery.

In his capacity as justice of the peace, appellant received fines and other county revenue. Appellant set up a trust account with himself as trustee for the keeping of these funds. Appellant testified that it was his understanding that any county official could withdraw the funds from this account. In April, 1975, appellant withdrew these funds and paid them over to the Elko County Treasurer. At that time the county treasurer did not mention to appellant that he had a duty to pay these funds to the county treasurer on a monthly basis. See NRS 176.285. Instead, appellant let the money accumulate in the trust account.\nDuring his tenure, appellant and the district attorney were not communicating on a regular basis. In fact, the record reveals that their relationship was antagonistic. Appellant testifi...",

Moody dismissed the indictment on double jeopardy grounds. The state now appeals, arguing only that it was improper to have dismissed the charge of tampering with evidence.\nOn the evening of March 10, 1980, the body of Thomas Andrus was found in his burning pickup truck on a road near Peters Creek. Travis Dean Williams was indicted for the murder of Andrus. The state's case before the grand jury consisted of proof that Williams and Andrus were together the night of the homicide. Both were highly intoxicated. One important witness against Williams was Joyce Andrus, Thomas Andrus' wife. She testified that she had last seen her husband alive shortly before the homicide. She had left him at their home, a trailer, with Williams. The investigation of the Andrus homicide established ...",

Defendant and Dennis went in Defendant's truck to Cain's liquor store \"to rob the lady that was working there.\" Defendant was armed with a BB gun, and Dennis had a stun gun. As Graggs closed the store and went to her car, Defendant and Dennis attacked her. Defendant put his arm around her and \"put the BB gun to her like it was a real pistol.\" Dennis then demanded money from Graggs.

This appeal followed.\nAppellant first contends that the evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was guilty of murder in the first degree. When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we have repeatedly held that the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict winner giving that party the benefit of all reasonable inferences to be drawn. Commonwealth v. Strand, 464 Pa. 544, 347 A.2d 675 (1975).\nFrom the evidence, the jury could reasonably have concluded that the following circumstances surrounded the killing involved in this case. At 11:00 p.m., on October 18, 1974, Maurice Gray and the decedent, Steven Edwards, were standing on the corner of 56th and Lebanon Streets in Philadelphia, when they were surrounded by five youths.

State, 100 Nev. 74, 675 P.2d 409 (1984). This court affirmed Mazzan's conviction, but vacated his sentence and remanded the case to the district court for a second penalty hearing because Mazzan was denied effective assistance of counsel during his first penalty hearing. Mazzan, supra. At Mazzan's second penalty hearing, the jury found as aggravating circumstances that Mazzan committed the murder while engaged in the commission of a burglary and robbery. The jury found no mitigating circumstances sufficient to outweigh the aggravating circumstances and sentenced Mazzan to death. We affirm the *851 imposition of the death sentence against Mazzan.\nMazzan, a thirty-one year old hairdresser, and the victim were friends who spent much of the last day of the victim's life together. The victim, who had given Mazzan permission to spend the night at his residence, was found dead in a pool of blood the following morning. The victim had been stabbed fifte...",

Atty. Gen., Charleston, for appellee.\nA. David Abrams, Jr., Abrams, Byron, Henderson &amp; Richmond, Beckley, for appellant.\nNEELY, Chief Justice:\n\"The Hill\" in downtown Beckley, West Virginia is a rough part of town. Its bars, poolrooms, speakeasies, and disco joints cater to an evening sub-culture that emerges at night to the dismay of the ordinary, law-abiding citizen. It was outside of one of \"The Hill's\" establishments, the Nite Flite, that on 29 November 1981 the appellant, Robert Saunders, fatally shot Phillip Kincannon in the left buttocks, a wound from which Mr. Kincannon later bled to death on a pool table. Our appellant insists that by shooting Mr. Kincannon he was defending his brother, James Saunders. He argues that his conviction of first-degree murder and sentence of life imprisonment with a recommendation of mercy should be reversed because, inter alia, the circuit court refused an instruction on defense of another as an extension of the affirmative defense of self-defense.\n\nI.\nConfusion and conflicting testimony surround the death of Mr. Kincannon. It appears, however, that the appellant's brother, James Saunders, was involved in a series of fights with the Kincannon brothers, *675 Phillip and Brian. During one of these altercations, Brian Kincannon, assisted by his br...",

INTRODUCTION\n\nThe Alaska Department of Revenue Child Support Enforcement Division (CSED) appeals a superior court order requiring CSED to reimburse Enoch Mitchell for child support he paid pursuant to a 1990 default judgment that the court set aside in 1993. We conclude that it was not error to order CSED to reimburse Mitchell those amounts which the State retained, but that it was error to order CSED to reimburse Mitchell for those amounts the State paid as Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). We therefore affirm in part and reverse in part and remand for modification of the judgment.\n\n\n*1286 II. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n\n\nA. Allegations Regarding Paternity\n\nPeter Marks was born in May 1987. In July 1989 his mother, Ellen Marks (Marks), signed a CSED paternity affidavit naming Enoch Mitchell as the child's father; it was filed with CSED in Anchorage.[1] In early November 1989 Mitchell completed an Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) paternity statement declaring ...",

Evans, has filed with this Court a petition, pro se, for post-conviction relief alleging he was denied effective assistance of counsel. The Attorney General of the State of Montana has filed a response asserting that the petitioner's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are procedurally barred.\nOn September 28, 1989, the petitioner was convicted of aggravated burglary, two counts of felony assault and one count of felony theft by a jury sitting in the District Court of the Eighteenth Judicial District, Gallatin County. The petitioner was represented by appointed counsel during his trial in the District Court. After his convictions, the petitioner obtained new counsel and appealed to this Court. His convictions were affirmed on appeal in State v. Evans (Mont. 1991), 806 P.2d 512, 48 St. Rep. 170.\nIn his petition, the petitioner raises the following claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel:\n(1) counsel should have contested the legality of the initial entry of police officers into the defendant's apartment; (2) counsel failed to move to suppress evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant issued to search defendant's apartment; (3) counsel presented no defense and engaged in a conflict of interest because counsel believed petitioner to be guilty; (4) counsel failed to file a change of venue motion; (5) counsel faile...",

She sought treatment because she recently had been raped and was also a victim of childhood incest.  During the course of McNicholes's treatment, Subotnik and McNicholes became involved in a sexual relationship, which, according to the undisputed evidence in this case, resulted from Subotnik's mishandling of the transference-countertransference phenomenon.3\n    \n    \n      3\n      McNicholes filed an action against Subotnik in the District Court claiming severe psychological injuries resulting from her sexual relationship with him.

The appeal is from a dismissal of the complaint on motions to dismiss. We are affirming the action of the trial court.\nIn July 1956 appellant was arrested in the City of Lake Louisvilla for speeding, precipitating a legal snarl which is now before this court for the fourth time and was aptly described by the late Judge Cammack as a \"tempest in a teapot.\" See Murphy v. City of Lake Louisvilla, Ky. 1957, 303 S.W.2d 306, 307. Chronologically, the situation developed as follows:\nIn 1955 the trustees of the city had enacted an ordinance making it unlawful to operate an automobile within the city at a speed exceeding 15 miles per hour and prescribing a fine up to $50. Appellant, Helen Murphy (now McCray), a resident of the town, was arrested on July 26, 1956, by the appellee Earl Smith, a deputy marshal for the city, for...",

In accordance with the jury's recommendation, the Honorable Nancy Coats sentenced Traywicks to 250 years imprisonment. Traywicks has perfected his appeal of this conviction.\nTraywicks raises the following propositions of error in support of his appeal:\nI. The trial court's refusal to continue Mr. Traywicks' trial or bar Officer Bevel's expert testimony prevented appellant from receiving a fair trial and effective assistance of counsel;\nII. Prosecutorial misconduct denied Mr. Traywicks a fair trial in violation of United States and Oklahoma Constitutions; and\nIII.

Leonard to the offense of second-degree murder, MCLA 750.317; MSA 28.549, pursuant to a plea bargain. On February 6, 1976, defendant was brought before Judge Clarence Laster for sentence. Defendant was advised that Judge Leonard was ill and that Judge Laster was going to pronounce sentence. Defendant and his counsel then asked that defendant be allowed to withdraw his plea of guilty and proceed to trial. It is rather obvious from a reading of the transcript that defendant and his counsel were displeased with the fact that defendant was not going to be sentenced by Judge Leonard whom they considered to be a lenient sentencer. Defendant then went on to explain to the court that the only reason that he pled guilty was because of the influence of his counsel; that he did not commit the crime; and that he wanted the police department to investigate the crime and \"see w...",

In support of his request for a certificate of appealability under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253(c), Mr. Williams argues that:  (1) the government's forfeiture of his property prohibited his subsequent criminal prosecution under the Double Jeopardy Clause;  (2) his punishment for money laundering resulted in multiple punishments for conspiracy in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause;  and (3) his guilty plea was unknowing and involuntary because it was provided in reliance on his attorney's erroneous calculation of his maximum possible sentence.\n    \n    \n      2\n      Mr. Williams' first claim is precluded by United States v. Ursery, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 2135, 135 L.Ed.2d 549 (1996), in which the Supreme Court held that civil forfeitures do not constitute punishment for Double Jeopardy purposes.  Id. at 2138.   Mr. Williams' second claim is precluded by Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932), because the government's conspiracy charge did not require proof of fi...",

Trial counsel filed a motion for new trial on February 7, 1994, asserting that there was insufficient evidence to support the verdict; the motion was denied on August 13, 1998.

This enumeration lacks merit.

Frederic Voros, Jr. and Jan Graham, Salt Lake City, for Appellee.\nBefore ORME, BENCH and WILKINS, JJ.\nORME, Presiding Judge:\nDefendant Tracy Candelario appeals his sentence for robbery. Defendant contends that merely threatening the use of a firearm is not enough to warrant a one-year enhancement under Utah Code Ann. § 76-3-203(2) (Supp.1995) when the perpetrator does not actually carry or display a dangerous weapon or a facsimile or likeness of a dangerous weapon. We disagree and affirm defendant's sentence.\n\nFACTS\nDefendant entered a credit union and demanded money from a cashier. He claimed to have a gun and threatened to kill her if she did not comply. Defendant did not display a handgun, and, in fact, was not carrying a gun or a facsimile of a gun at the time. Neither did he maneuver his hand in his pocket or otherwise physically gesture that he had a gun. Nonetheless, he left the credit union with $2000 more than he went in with.\nDefendant was charged with one count of aggravated robbery, a first degree felony in violation of Utah Code Ann. § 76-6-302 (1995). Pursuant to a plea agreement, defendant pled guilty to robbery, a second degree felony. See id. § 76-6-301. Relying on section *278 76-3-203(2), the trial court added an ...",

Peters, to require him to contribute to her support. The parties, now in their early fifties, were married in 1924, and have one son. Mr. Peters is and has been employed near Crescent, in Potta-wattamie County, by Illinois Central Railroad Company, which provides him with a house nearby. The parties and their son occupied this house from 1945 until the spring of 1952, when flood waters submerged it. They then moved temporarily to the home of Mr. Peters' mother in Council Bluffs. Their relations had not been harmonious for some time. They returned to Crescent together about the middle of June, 1952. Mrs. Peters stopped at the farm of her parents and Mr. Peters went to the family home. The immediate cause of their separation is not clearly shown. Apparently it was voluntary on the part of both. Mrs. Peters went to Council Bluffs, rented quarters there for herself and the son, then eighteen years old, and secured employment in a retail store. Mr. Peters continued to live alone in the family home, the renovation of which was not completed by the railroad company for several...",

Held:\n1. In one enumeration, J. B. complains the evidence is insufficient to sustain the findings of delinquency. The juvenile judge was authorized to conclude based upon the evidence presented that on the last day of school in the spring of 1983, J. B., along with four other boys, was cutting class and otherwise showing a disdain for school rules. During the lunch hour, the five boys, aged 14 and 15, were in the school auditorium. One or two were taking turns playing the piano. While they were there, the victim, a 14-year-old girl, came to the door of the auditorium looking for a particular boy. The 14-year-old girl was a retarded learner taking special education classes in the public high school. She had an IQ of 65 and the mental level of about a 12-year-old.\nThe girl came three times to the auditorium looking for the same boy.

After obtaining a bag of money from McClure, the man forced the patron outside at gunpoint and ran off. When the police arrived, McClure described the gun as being black with a small green mark on the side, and said he was unsure whether it was real or a toy.\nSeveral hours later, the police officer who made the robbery report noticed appellant *964 and a companion in another part of town. Because appellant fit the description of the robbery suspect, the officer approached the men. When he saw appellant throw a gun into the bushes, he ordered both men in front of his car and handcuffed them. Upon retrieving the gun, the officer discovered that it was a toy gun with a green plastic projectile showing on the side.\nAn assisting officer went to the 7-Eleven and told McClure that they had someone they wanted him to identify. McClure rode in the squad car to where the suspects were standing handcuffed in front of another police vehicle. While McClure remaine...",

Payne is held under penalty of death at the Mecklenburg Correctional Center as a result of his conviction on April 29, 1986, in the Circuit Court of Powhatan County on charges of capital murder. Payne filed the instant petition and an accompanying motion for evidentiary hearing on July 30, 1993. Respondent thereafter filed a motion to dismiss on September 24, 1993.\nIn the offense of conviction, Payne was found guilty of the March 3, 1985, murder of David Wayne Dunford. While Payne and Dunford were both inmates at Powhatan Correctional Center, Dunford was burned in his cell when an assailant padlocked his cell door, doused the cell with flammable liquid, and ignited it with matches. The Commonwealth's case against Payne rested largely on the testimony of another inmate and an alleged eyewitness  Robert Smith. After arriving at a verdict of guilty on April 29, 1986, the next day the jury fixed Payne's sentence at death. The Circuit Court pr...",

The trial court found that the bogus documentary drafts were not documentary drafts (as defined by the Uniform Commercial Code), but mere writings used in a fraudulent scheme. The court concluded that, although Twin City Bank, the payor/drawee bank, was late in returning the \"drafts\" unpaid to First State Bank of Sherwood, the depositary/collecting bank, the writings used in the scheme were not documentary drafts. As such, the court held the UCC provision making a payor bank accountable for late return did not apply and the depositary bank was left with the loss. We disagree and reverse and remand. This case was certified to this court by the court of appeals pursuant to Sup.Ct.R. 29(1)(c) and (4)(b).\nJoseph Tucker, d/b/a Tucker's Used Cars, was a customer of First State Bank of Sherwood (FSB), appellant.

Francis Eugene White was convicted of aggravated assault by a circuit court jury. On appeal, he argues prejudicial error in statements made by the prosecutor during opening and closing arguments. White also asserts that his counsel was ineffective, and that certain defense witnesses were improperly excluded. We find no error singly or cumulatively, and affirm.\n\nFACTS\n¶ 2. White denies that he was the person who in disguise committed this assault. Nonetheless, the following describes the testimony and inferences that were consistent with the verdict of guilt. On October 22, 1996, the sixty-two year old defendant traveled from his home in Pascagoula to the Long Beach dwelling of his estranged wife, Carol. White was disguised as a telephone repairman, wearing a hard hat and false mustache, and carrying a wire *889 cage box with tools. White cut the cable television wire connected to the house, presumably mistaking it for the telephone line.\n¶ 3. White's wife Carol was having an affair with Bill Ford.

Kemper guilty of armed robbery, hijacking a motor vehicle, aggravated assault, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime. The court sentenced Kemper to 25 years confinement. On appeal Kemper challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain his armed robbery conviction, and argues that his aggravated assault conviction should have merged with either his hijacking or armed robbery conviction. We affirm.\nThe evidence showed that Kemper approached the victim in a parking lot as he entered his vehicle. Kemper opened the passenger's side door of the victim's vehicle and sat down with a gun on his lap. Kemper then ordered the victim to open the trunk and to walk to the back of the vehicle. When the victim failed to do as instructed, Kemper took the victim's keys and opened the trunk. The victim then took money out of his pocket, asked Kemper to \"please just take the money, take the car ...,\" and laid the money inside the trunk. Kemper responded, \"no, get in the trunk,\" and pointed the gun at the victim. The two men then struggled, the gun fired, and the victim ran. Officers later found the gun and the victim's keys several blocks away, but found no money.\n1. Kemper contends th...",

In said final judgment, the following provision is found:\n* * * * * *\n\"5. The Court awards as rehabilitative alimony to be paid by the Respondent-Husband to the Petitioner-Wife the lump-sum alimony of Thirty Thousand ($30,000.00) Dollars to be paid on the basis of One Thousand ($1,000.00) Dollars per month for the next thirty (30) months commencing January 1, 1973.\"\n* * * * * *\nSubsequent thereto, the former wife remarried.

The defendant who is now confined in a Federal penitentiary in Washington complains that Minnesota prosecuting authorities deny his constitutional right to a speedy trial by failure to institute removal proceedings which will bring him to Minnesota for prosecution on a charge pending here. Although the order before us is probably not appealable, we treat it, because of the nature of the relief sought, as a petition for a writ of mandamus directing the District Court of Hennepin County to give the defendant an immediate trial or in the alternative to dismiss the proceedings.\nFrom the record it appears that on August 29, 1960, a complaint was *75 filed in the municipal court of Minneapolis, Hennepin County, charging the defendant with having committed the offense of second-degree forgery. At that time the defendant was in custody of the police at Santa Barbara, California. Upon learning of his whereabouts the Minneapolis Police Department contacted the authorities ...",

Section 1983 which allegedly resulted from the city's refusal to allow Kleiber to operate a mobile hot dog stand on the sidewalks of downtown Idaho Falls. We affirm.\nIn May 1982 Kleiber applied to the city of Idaho Falls for a business license to operate a mobile hot dog stand in downtown Idaho Falls.

The circuit court dismissed the case because: (1) the Department failed to appeal the administrative decision within the time frame prescribed by W.Va.Code, 29-6A-7, and (2) the Department failed to pay the circuit court's filing fee \"in advance,\" as required by W.Va.Code, 59-1-11 (1990). We find that the circuit court erred. Moreover, because the Department did not have a full and fair opportunity to rebut the ground on which the grievance was sustained, we reverse and remand the case for an evidentiary hearing on whether the Department discriminated against the appellees by showing \"favoritism\" to another employee of the Department.[1]\n\nI.\nThe appellees, Warren Hess, John Mellinger, and Vicki Britner, are all employed by the Depart...",

Green went to the Southern Motors car dealership in Savannah and expressed interest in a 1991 Honda Accord. Bremer, a sales associate, spoke to Green a few moments until sales associate Silverstein could actually assist Green. At Green's request, Silverstein agreed to accompany him for a test drive, even though the dealership was to close in 20 minutes. It was still daylight. The two struck up a conversation during the drive, primarily focused on their military service in the Persian Gulf conflict. Silverstein became *205 suspicious when Green was evasive in answering certain questions about his family and experiences in the military. He began to look for distinguishing marks on Green and noticed a prominent footprint-shaped scar or birthmark on Green's arm.\nGreen drove the car into an apartment complex, indicating to Silverstein that he wanted to show the car to a friend. ...",

He pled guilty to one count of felony murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment. In exchange for the guilty plea, the State agreed to enter a nolle prosequi on the other charges and not to oppose parole after 14 years. Shortly thereafter, McCutchen retained new counsel who filed a motion to withdraw the guilty plea, which the trial court denied. McCutchen appeals,[1] contending that the guilty plea was void because his trial attorney rendered ineffective assistance in failing to confer with him or to investigate exculpatory or mitigating evidence.\nTo prevail on this claim, McCutchen \"must show that his lawyer's performance was deficient and that, but for [his] errors, there is a reasonable probability he would have insisted on going to trial.

Ziegler, an inmate serving a sentence for burglary in the Utah State Prison, was placed in isolated confinement after engaging in an attempt to escape and making an assault upon a prison guard. He filed in district court a petition in habeas corpus1 alleging cruel and unusual punishment in denying his constitutional rights of free speech, freedom of religion, and access to the library and to legal materials. Upon the basis of the representations made to the district court, it ruled that he had shown no grounds for relief, including that he had not exhausted his administrative remedies. He appeals.\nIn considering his contentions, it is appropriate to have in mind the purpose and the scope of habeas corpus. Though its original purpose was to test the lawfulness of the cause of one’s restraint or imprisonment, or the propriety of proceedings relating thereto, it is not to be doubted that the understanding of the nature of the writ has been broadened to test other alleged violations of basic rights;2 and that this would include cruel and unusual punishment,3 or anything that would properly fit within that charge.4\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, in order to state a ground for relief, it must appear from such a petition, (1) that there is some such violation of a basic right; and (2) that the petitioner has exhausted his administrative remedies, before seeking relief from the courts.5 The reason for this is that, consistent with their obligation of...",

The defendant pleaded not guilty and elected to be tried by a jury of twelve. The case was tried and the jury returned a verdict of guilty of murder in the second degree. The defendant was sentenced by the court to life imprisonment, and it is from this judgment that he has taken the present appeal.\nThe defendant has made a claim of error in the denial of his motion to set aside the verdict as being contrary to law and against the evidence. The appeal having been taken before the rules for taking appeals in jury cases were amended effective October 1, 1974, such a claim is tested by the evidence printed in the appendices to the briefs and such exhibits as are made a part of the record.

A misconduct hearing was held and resulted in plaintiff's being found guilty and his custody status being reclassified, segregating him from the general prison population. A petition for rehearing was filed, which was denied by the Department of Corrections.\nPrior to the final agency determination plaintiff filed a petition seeking judicial review under the Administrative Procedures Act, MCL 24.301 et seq.; MSA 3.560(201) et seq. Defendant did not answer but filed a certified copy of the record pursuant to MCL 24.304(2); MSA 3.560(204)(2). Plaintiff caused a default to be entered for failure of defendant to answer. Defendant moved to set aside the default and by letter waived oral argument on the motion and advised the court that the defendant would stand on the record as filed. Thereafter, the court issued an opinion wherein it found plaintiff's petition to be without merit. Plaintiff moved for reconsideration of the court's decision, wh...",

McMahon (claimant) appeals from orders of the Workers’ Compensation Court denying benefits under the Occupational Disease Act and the Workers’ Compensation Act. Claimant sought benefits under both Acts simultaneously in separate proceedings. The two cases have been consolidated for purposes of appeal. We remand for further proceedings.\nClaimant worked at the Anaconda Company’s copper refinery in Great Falls from 1956 through December 6, 1978 as an inspector. During this period, claimant was continuously exposed to moderate levels of sulphuric acid, organic arsenic, zinc, lead, copper, tellurium, asbestos, silver, dust and other compounds in the refinery environment.\n*484Claimant complains of throat and lung problems secondary to the exposure to the environment at work, and resulting aggravation of psychological problems. Claimant was diagnosed as having “chronic obstructive lung disease,” “laryngeal irritation,” “leukoplakia of the vocal cords,” “severe anxiety” and other psychological problems.\nExamining physicians agree that claimant’s physical ailments result more from claimant’s one to two pack a day cigarette habit than from the exposure to fumes, etc. at his work. However, the Occupational Disease Panel concluded that the disability attributable to the physical ailments was “about 15 percent related to his occupation.”\nThe level of disability due to Claimant’s physical ailments is sketchy.

The Supreme Court of Arizona reversed the murder and assault convictions because of erroneous jury instructions, but affirmed the judgments of conviction on the drug counts.  Applicant now requests a stay of his second trial on the murder and assault counts, presently scheduled to take place on November 4, for the reason that evidence which he claims was obtained in violation of his rights under the United States Constitution will be admitted at that trial.  The evidence in question was found by the Supreme Court of Arizona to have been properly admitted in his first trial, but applicant is seeking review of that determination in a petition for certiorari presently pending before this Court.  He asks that the stay of his retrial be effective until his petition for certiorari is finally disposed of here.\n    \n    \n      2\n      The petition for certiorari is less than precise as to how much of the judgment of the Supreme Court of Arizona applicant wishes this Court to review.

PEARSON, Judge.\nThe order under review denied Leeds' motion to tax as costs the fees of an engineer employed by Leeds to give expert testimony. The engineer's testimony was that the faulty operation of a sewerage lift station constructed by the City of Homestead on that portion of Leeds' property taken by the City under its power of eminent domain[1] resulted in the emission of noise, noxious odors and effluent and decreased the value of the adjoining property still owned by Leeds.\nThe damages to Leeds' property which were sought to be established by the testimony of the engineer were not damages caused by the taking, but instead, damages resulting from the manner in which the lift station was constructed. Such consequential damages must be sought by a separate claim in tort and are not severance damages recoverable in eminent domain proceedings. Kendry v.

We see no reason to reopen an avenue to litigation that the Legislature, in its wisdom, closed in 1935 by enactment of a statute codified at Code 1975, § 6-5-331.\nWe affirm the judgment dismissing the case and adopt the following language from Arnac v. Wright, 163 Ga.App. 33, 292 S.E.2d 440, 442 (1982):\n\"A review of the complaint shows allegations of `seduction,' `illicit relations,' and `estranged ... affections,' which [are] synonymous with and the equivalent of pleading adultery, criminal conversation, and alienation of affections. Stated another way, without the marriage contract no husband could bring an action based upon adultery, alienation of a wife's affections, or criminal conversation. All are inextricably intertwined.\n\"....\n\"... It is impossible to have an action based on adultery, alienation of a wife's affections, or criminal conversation, without a prior marriage contract. And when the legislature abolished the former, it included by implication [an action based on] the latter.\"\nSee, also, Norris v.

Herring, Carson City, for appellant.\nBrian McKay, Atty. Gen., Carson City, and Larry G. Bettis, Dist. Atty., Mineral County, for respondent.\n\nOPINION\nPER CURIAM:\nThis is an appeal from an order of the district court denying appellant's petition for post-conviction relief. Appellant was charged with sexual assault, a violation of NRS 200.366, and lewdness with a child under fourteen years of age, a violation of NRS 201.230. Following a jury trial, he was convicted and sentenced on the sexual assault charge to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole until he serves at least ten years, and on the lewdness charge to ten years in prison, the sentences to run concurrently. In this appeal, appellant contends that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel before and during trial, and therefore was denied his right to a fair trial. We agree, and accordingly reverse and remand this case for a new trial.\nAt appellant's trial, the state presented the testimony of only two witnesses, the alleged victim (appellant's eleven-year-old stepdaughter, Dee) and appellant's wife. The only witnesses with any personal knowledge of the events in question were Dee, appellant, and possibly Dee's seven-year-old brother, Arthur. There was no physical evidence of the alleged incidents; Dee was...",

We affirm.\nThe record shows that on October 24, 1986, Dykes pled guilty to seven counts of financial transaction card fraud. The record contains a plea memorandum signed by Dykes and his counsel, which provides that Dykes would plead guilty to all the charges and that all prior probation would be revoked. The plea agreement provided for ten years confinement on the new financial transaction fraud charges, \"leaving it up to the Judge\" as to any probation to follow. The memorandum also noted that Dykes would acknowledge other financial transaction fraud charges that were not charged in the accusation. In connection with his plea, Dykes and his trial attorney signed the accusation in the case directly under language reading, \"The Defendant ... waives copy of accusation, list of witnesses and being formally arraigned, waives indictment by the Grand Jury of said County, and also waives trial by jury, and pleads guilty.\" No other documents regarding his guilty plea exist in the record.

The complaint, as amended, sought recovery based upon breach of contract, negligence, and fraud. Named as defendants to the action were Bill Brewer &amp; Associates, Inc., the contractor for the reconstruction of the condominium; and its principal, William S. A. Brewer.\nThe facts adduced at trial showed that the replacement roof in question was installed in May 1979. There was evidence, though disputed in part by appellants, showing that the roof developed numerous leaks and that Brewer contacted the installer on numerous occasions through the summer of 1980 regarding the leaks. There was also evidence showing that although some of the leaks had been repaired, the roof was generally unsuitable and defective.\nAppellee Strange testified that she initially contacted Brewer about the condominium in June 1980. She testified that she was told by Brewer that a new proof had been installed as a part of the overall repair and reconstruction of the condominium.

We conclude that there is no showing of the prejudice necessary for the application of laches. We also conclude there is no basis to uphold the trial court's dismissal of the action on the alternate basis of res judicata. Therefore, we vacate the summary judgment and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings.\n\n\n*349 I.\n\nTHE BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS.\nIn 1886, Jerome Helsley appropriated three cubic feet of water per second (cfs) for irrigation and domestic use from Deadwood Creek, located in Owyhee County. Deadwood Creek is a tributary of the East Fork of the Bruneau River, which is a tributary of the Bruneau River. In 1915, the district court in Owyhee County adjudicated this water right in the name of Helsley's successor, Karl Patrick.\nIn 1920, the Grand View Irrigation District (the irrigation district) filed an action in district co...",

A jury returned a verdict of guilty and the court sentenced him to six years imprisonment. He appeals alleging the trial court erred in four respects. A brief summary of the facts established by the state's evidence will provide a sufficient background against which these allegations of error may be considered.\nOn October 15, 1977, in Sikeston, Missouri, between 9:00 p. m. and 10:00 p. m. Wren parked his car in a parking lot for the purpose of picking up his mother who worked at a restaurant across the street. As he started to walk to the restaurant, he was accosted by two young black men. They asked for a ride and mentioned the name of a club. When he declined, one of the two brandished a handgun. At the direction of his assailants, Wren drove about Sikeston for 15 to 20 minutes. Then, at their direction, he drove toward Charleston. After driving 5 to 7 miles, in compliance with his assailants' command, he stopped, got out and started walking. The two dro...",

Having found an enhancement allegation to be true, the jury sentenced him to life imprisonment in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Institutional Division. In five points of error, Anderson claims that the trial court erred in: 1) excusing a prospective juror who was not shown to be disqualified; 2) allowing the prosecution to argue facts not in evidence; 3) making an evidentiary ruling which was an opinion as to the weight of the evidence; 4) failing to declare a mistrial on his own motion or give a curative instruction following a prejudicial remark by a State witness; and 5) allowing an improper \"outcry\" witness to offer hearsay testimony from the injured party.\nWe affirm.\nIn his first point of error, Anderson complains that the trial court erred in excusing, sua sponte, prospective juror Adcock for cause. During voir dire, the State elicited from this juror that he had been convicted of felony theft...",

Cronin, and Keith E. Roberts, all of Donovan &amp; Roberts, of Wheaton, for appellant.\nJ. William Hayton, of Bell, Boyd, Lloyd, Haddad &amp; Burns, of Chicago, for appellee.\nJudgment affirmed.\nMr. JUSTICE RECHENMACHER delivered the opinion of the court:\nThe plaintiff appeals from the trial court's order dismissing its complaint in an action for damages and injunctive relief arising out of alleged unfair competition and deceptive trade practices.\n 1 The amended complaint is in two counts  count I being for money damages based apparently on the common law tort of unfair competition and count II for damages and injunctive relief based on the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1975, ch. 121 1/2, par. 311 et seq.). This Act is generally considered to have codified the common law tort of unfair competition. (Mars, Inc. v. Curtiss Candy Co. (1972), 8 Ill. App. 3d 338.) The specific complaint of the plaintiff here is that the defendant caused a likelihood of confusion or misunderstanding as to the source of goods, citing section 2(2) of the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act, which reads as follows:\n\"A person engages in a deceptive trade practice when, in the course of his business, vocation or occu...",

It is not disputed that he *598 set fire to four separate unoccupied buildings which were used as dwellings. After a trial, he was found guilty. He pleaded guilty to five counts of burglary.\nTwo issues are presented:\n1. Whether the inclusion of the term dwelling (RCW 9A.04.110(7))[1] within the definition of building (RCW 9A.04.110(5))[2] permits the prosecutor unconstitutional discretion to charge either first-degree[3] or second-degree[4] arson on the same set of facts; and\n2. Whether the trial court abused its discretion in sentencing defendant so four of the five burglary terms should run concurrently but the fifth one should run consecutively to the other four.\n[1] With regard to the first issue, any potential for impermissible discretion in the charging of first- or second-degree arson is obviated by the prefatory remarks to RCW *599 9A.04.110  \"unless a different meaning plainly is required.\" This proviso, as well as RCW 9A.04.020(2),[5] comport with the controlling case law (e.g., State ex rel.

Defendant appeals his conviction and sentence. We affirm.\n\nFACTS\nDuring the first week of April 1987, defendant made an unannounced visit to the home of Charles Basco, a lifelong acquaintance who resided in Sabine Parish. Defendant, who had not communicated with Basco for about six years, informed him that an individual named Huey P. Long was going to testify against defendant in a criminal trial. Long and defendant had both been charged with aggravated burglary and attempted aggravated arson of the dwelling of Dale Behan.\nReturning to Basco's home a few days later, defendant informed Basco that Long's testimony would destroy defendant's business and stated that something would have to be done about Long. Basco agreed to look into the matter. Defendant subsequently returned to Basco's home a third time and told Basco that \"[t]he man had to besomething done with him,\" and asked if anyone had been located to do the job.\nShortly after defendant's third visit, Basco met with Manning Coleman, Jr. at Coleman's residence in Beauregard Parish.

His punishment was *691 fixed at a term of seven (7) years imprisonment, and from said judgment and sentence, a timely appeal has been perfected to this Court.\nThere are several assignments of error raised by the defendant's brief; however, for the purposes of this opinion it is only necessary to consider one and that is the defendant's contention that the trial court erred in admitting the testimony of the complaining witness, Mrs. Charles Hood, concerning her in-court identification of the defendant.\nThe evidence reflects that Mrs. Hood was an eyewitness at the scene of the offense, her home. Subsequent to the offense and prior to trial, she identified the defendant in a police lineup. Prior to and during the lineup, the defendant was not represented by counsel and specifically did not waive his right to same.\nThe evidence further reflects that at approximately 1:30 a.m. on the night in question, the complaining witness awoke to ...",

The next day a meeting was arranged between Agent Wright and Phillips. The informant gave Wright approximately one ounce of PCP which he said he had obtained from the appellant's house. Phillips advised Wright that Mrs. Helfrich had told him she had one pound of PCP and was looking for someone to sell it to. At that time Phillips telephoned Helfrich. The call was recorded by Wright. The agent and informant then went to the residence where, outside the home, Wright gave Phillips $500 with which to purchase the PCP. The informant then went into the house wearing a microphone; however, the recording produced was inaudible. He later returned to...",

If a defendant, whose trial has not been postponed upon his application, is not brought to trial within sixty days after the finding of the indictment, or filing of the information.\"\n The information in the instant prosecution was filed on September 11, 1945, therefore, pursuant to said section 1382, supra, appellant would normally be entitled to a trial on or before November 10th, the sixtieth day after filing of the information. The cause was set for trial on October 22d, at which time it was continued to October 31st at the request of appella...",

Zimmerman pled nolo contendere and was convicted of attempted arson in the second degree, a class C felony. AS 11.46.410; AS 11.31.100. Superior Court Judge Charles K. Cranston sentenced her to two years' imprisonment and suspended all but ninety days. He placed Zimmerman on probation for five years, subject to certain conditions of probation, only one of which is in issue here. Zimmerman appeals her sentence. She challenges the order requiring her to make restitution. She contends that the trial court's order that she pay $5,700 restitution was not supported by a finding that she had the future earning capacity necessary to make restitution. The order, in her view, was therefore in violation of statute. We agree and remand.\nZimmerman and her husband are separated. Zimmerman's husband remained in the family residence and Zimmerman moved elsewhere. On August 28, 1984, Zimmerman returned to the family residence and intentionally set a fire in order to scare her husband. The fire was set through the use of a kerosene drench...",

He had formerly engaged in some placer mining, including a little unsuccessful prospecting on the land in question.

Buttram was acquitted of two other counts of wire fraud.\nThe indictment charged both Frank Exum and Myron Buttram with three counts of wire fraud. However, on September 14, 1976, the court granted an oral motion of Assistant United States Attorney James West dismissing all charges against Exum.\nExum had been sent to the Federal Psychiatric Center in Springfield, Missouri, pursuant to an order of Judge Luther B. Eubanks of the Western District of Oklahoma before whom Exum faced other federal charges unrelated to this case. Initially, on June 17, 1976, a report from Jack Eardly, M.D., Chief of Psychiatry at the Springfield facility adjudged Exum competent to stand trial. However, the Springfield staff changed their mind and in a letter dated August 9, 1976, from Eardly to Judge Eubanks found Exum to have been legally insane during the period he allegedly committed federal crimes in Oklahoma.

The court also denied a motion under I.C.R. 35 for reconsideration of the sentence imposed. Schneider appeals, contending that the court abused its sentencing discretion by ordering that he serve the entire sentence in confinement without the possibility of release on parole.\nAfter Schneider's opening brief on appeal was filed but before the State had filed a responding brief, Schneider escaped from the institution where he was being held by the Board of Correction. He was captured and returned to the Board's custody four days later.

Code Crim.P.Ann. art. 55.01.[2]\n*325 On June 12, 1982, Mark Andrew Elliott was arrested and charged with burglary of a building. Two days later, Elliott waived indictment, and the cause proceeded on a felony information. Elliott waived a jury and pled guilty. The trial court found that the evidence substantiated Elliott's guilt, but it deferred adjudication of his guilt and placed him on probation for three years. On January 11, 1984, the trial court granted an early termination of the deferred adjudication and dismissed the cause of action.\nIn February 1989, Elliott filed a petition to expunge all records of his arrest. The Harris County District Attorney, the Harris County District Clerk, and the Harris County Sheriff filed general denials. After a hearing, the trial court ordered expunction. From this order, only the Harris County District Attorney has appealed.\nIn his sole point of error, the district attorney contends that Elliott offered no evidence to satisfy the three requirements for expunction.\nArticle 55.01 provides that a person charged with a felo...",

The defendant and her witnesses claimed that the defendant was acting in self-defense, and, at the time of the difficulty, the prosecuting witness was armed with a knife. The state's evidence was that the assault occurred outside the defendant's apartment `in the yard', while the defendant and her witnesses insisted that it occurred inside the defendant's apartment.\"\nUnder those facts, the trial court charged upon self-de...",

The judgment ordered Balzam to permit Cohen on the business premises and awarded to Cohen such damages as he had sustained while wrongfully excluded from the business, the amount to be determined by a subsequent accounting. Despite his awareness of the mandatory requirements of the final judgment, Balzam continued to refuse Cohen access to the business premises. That conduct resulted in post trial proceedings in which Balzam was found to be in contempt, the penalty for which was a fine of $1,000.00 a day until Balzam complied.

Thus, defendant's cumulative incarceration on these two sentences was 18 years. Defendant appeals his sentences as excessive.

Judgment and sentence was imposed on January 5, 1971 and this appeal perfected therefrom.\nIt was charged by information that the defendant on August 21, 1970, did unlawfully and forcefully break into the Hubbard Grocery in Albany, Bryan County, said store being owned by M.R. Hubbard, and from the premises stole change and currency, credit cards, Bank Americard, candy, flashlight, socks, canned goods, cartons of cigarettes and cigars without the permission of the owner. The evidence established that the Hubbard Grocery was unlawfully broken into on August 21, 1970, by breaking through a side door. Merchandise including socks, canned goods, cigarettes, flashlight, and credit cards were taken. Some of the stolen items were recovered in a pasture out of which Mr. Hubbard saw the defendant drive the evening after the burglary.

From an adverse judgment the plaintiff has appealed.\nThe complaint named two defendants, Colonial Homes, Inc., and M.A. Shaw, who was also president of the corporate co-defendant. Service of process upon M.A. Shaw was delayed until some five days before the trial date. The issues between the plaintiff and the defendant, Colonial Homes, Inc., were tried separately at the request of the plaintiff pursuant to Section 21-1-1 (42) (b), N.M.S.A. 1953. The complaint was based on a single claim against both defendants. In due time a judgment was entered dismissing the complaint as to the defendant Colonial Homes, Inc., and further reciting that jurisdiction of the cause was retained as to the issues between the plaintiff and the defendant M.A. Shaw.\nBefore reaching the issues presented by the appellant we are met at the outset with Supreme Court Rule 5 (1) also referred to as Section 21-2-1 (5) (1), N.M.S.A. 1953, providing for appeals from final judgments.\nIn Floyd v.

We affirm.\n\nFACTS\nOn March 2, 1996, Isaac, a guest passenger in a vehicle driven by Michael Sarpy, was injured when the vehicle rear-ended another vehicle. As a result of this accident, Isaac filed suit against Sarpy and his insurer, Patterson Insurance Company, and her own insurer, Safeway, for uninsured motorist (UM) coverage. In her petition, Isaac claimed that her rejection of UM coverage \"was not done in accordance with the legal mandates concerning the rejection of uninsured motorist coverage.\" Thus, she claimed that she was entitled to UM coverage as though she had elected to carry such coverage. Safeway answered denying liability and cross-claiming against Sarpy as a defendant. Later, in a supplemental answer, Safeway denied coverage due to Isaac's valid waiver of UM coverage. Prior to trial, Isaac settled with and released all of her claims against Sarpy and Patterson. In the Partial Mot...",

The testimony at trial presented conflicting versions of his involvement in the alleged sale, the government narcotics agent describing appellant as an active participant, the co-defendants alleging that he had nothing to do with the transaction.  Apparently believing the agent's story, the jury convicted Kruglak on both counts.\n    \n    \n      3\n      During closing argument, defense counsel blasted the narcotics agent, accusing him of lying and of conspiring to frame appellant.

After purchasing the car, Simmons discovered that the odometer reading had been changed to reflect a substantially lower mileage than that actually accumulated. The only question presented to us on appeal is whether the trial court erred in granting summary judgment against Simmons on its claim under Code 1975, § 6-5-101, for legal fraud.\nSection 6-5-101 provides:\n\"Misrepresentations of a material fact made willfully to deceive, or recklessly without knowledge, and acted on by the opposite party, or if made by mistake and innocently and acted on by the opposite party, constitute legal fraud.\"\nSimmons claims that the misrepresentation upon which he relied was the certification of correctness by Royal as to the odometer reading.

Additionally, the trial in this matter began before the decision in Miranda v.

Roth, 207 Kan. 691, 486 P.2d 1385. The facts are fully reported in that opinion and in State v. Chase, 206 Kan. 352, 480 P.2d 62.\nPertinent to this appeal is the fact the petitioner's jury was impanelled under K.S.A. 43-102. (G.S. 1868, ch. 54, § 2; L. 1876, ch. 104, § 2; R.S. 1923, 43-102; Repealed, L. 1971, ch. 176, § 22; July 1.) That statute provided that jurors shall be selected from those on the assessment rolls of the preceding year who possess the *414 qualification of electors. The assessment rolls covered owners of both real and personal property.\nThe petitioner contends such jury selection arbitrarily excluded a defi...",

Stone, Jr., Valdosta, for appellee.\nPOPE, Presiding Judge.\nEdward Herbst \"Ned\" Fullerton, the biological father of D.B.G. and C.M. G., appeals from a juvenile court order terminating his parental rights. Concluding that the lower court's ruling was supported by clear and convincing evidence, we affirm.\nThe father pled guilty to murdering the mother, and is currently serving a life sentence. He will first be eligible for parole in September 2009, when the children will be 16 and 19. The father murdered the mother by shooting her, and he had threatened her with a gun on previous occasions. On at least one of these occasions, the children were present. The father had a wife and other children in a nearby city, and kept the existence of the mother, D.B.G. and C.M.G. a secret. Since the mother was killed, the children have been living with their maternal uncle and his wife, who would like to adopt them.\n1. This is clear and convincing evidence of parental misconduct, and also this is sufficient to support the court's determination that termination of the father's parental rights is in the best interest of the children. See OCGA § 15-11-81(a). Although \"the mere fact that a parent kills another parent does not in and of itself result in the automatic forfeiture of the...",

On appeal he contends (1) the trial court erred in admitting alleged character evidence and (2) his trial counsel was ineffective. We discern no error and affirm.\nThe record reveals that Browne was tried for three purse snatchings that took place in Gwinnett County. An investigating officer testified that during his Gwinnett County investigation, he was unable to identify a suspect based on the descriptions given by the victims, so he made inquiries to DeKalb County police regarding purse snatchings in DeKalb. The officer received two photographic lineups from DeKalb police, and when asked why he prepared a lineup of his own involving Browne, the officer responded: \"The lineup that I obtained from DeKalb County was an older picture. I believe it was from '98. Mr. Browne had been picked upbasically, the picture was a better quality picture. I obtained a better picture of Mr. Browne and placed him in the lineup.\" The court allowed this testimony over objection from defense counsel that the officer's statements constituted improper character evidence.\nBrowne presented an alibi defense at trial.

To be approved as a warehouseman it was necessary that McLendon secure a surety bond guaranteeing the faithful performance of the warehouse contract. Hartford executed the surety bond to McLendon indemnifying G. F. A. for loss resulting from the warehouse storage agreement between G. F. A. and McLendon. McLendon operated the peanut storage warehouse until the latter part of December 1963, at which time there was a disagreement between G. F. A. and McLendon. G. F. A. then took over the operation of the warehouse under the terms and conditions of the contract between it and McLendon. At a later date G. F'. A. made a claim on the bond against Hartford contending the there were shortages in the amount of peanuts that it had stored with McLendon. Hartford, after paying G. F.

The bond further provided: “That in any accounting which may be had between the undersigned and the surety, the surety shall be entitled to credit for any and all disbursements in and about the matters herein contemplated, made by it in good faith under the belief that it is or was liable for the amounts so disburs...",

She asserts one ground for reversal which relates to the refusal of the trial court to suppress certain statements she made to Officer Marable. We affirm.\nThe sheriff's department received a call of a shooting and officers were dispatched to the area. Officer Gomez was the first on the scene. Defendant approached Gomez and informed him that the victim had stolen Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) from her and that she had shot him. (First statement.) Gomez testified, \"Mrs. Poller stated she did have a weapon and that it was underneath her coat.\" Gomez then took the gun from defendant. He placed her in the patrol car and \"asked her what had happened.\" Defendant was not given her rights pursuant to Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966).

He recovered a verdict against the defendant upon the claim that the defendant was negligent in allowing the scraper's tires to be run while in an overinflated condition and the overinflation caused the blowout. Defendant appeals.\nDefendant, B.F. Goodrich Company, contends the trial court erred in denying its motion for a directed verdict. Goodrich's motion was based upon the proposition that there was no evidence to establish that the tire was being operated in an overinflated condition. We agree with the trial court that there was such evidence.\nThe plaintiff was employed by a road contractor. The scraper was a piece of heavy equipment used for earth-moving. The defendant, Goodrich Company, supplied the tires for the contractor's equipment. Goodrich also provided an employee at the job site whose duties were to check the air pressure in ...",

The trial court directed a verdict on this issue in favor of the decedent's widow, appellee here, thereby holding the death accidental as a matter of law.  Since we have concluded that under Texas law the case raised questions for the jury, we reverse and remand for a new trial.\n    \n    \n      2\n      Two issues are presented for our decision.  One concerns the appropriateness of the directed verdict under the standards set by Boeing Co. v. Shipman, 5th Cir. 1969, 411 F.2d 365.  The other concerns the exclusion by the trial court of certain impeachment evidence offered by the insurance company.  We take up the issu...",

Appellant was found guilty by a jury and his punishment, enhanced by a prior conviction, was assessed at life in the Texas Department of Corrections. We affirm.\nIn appellant's first ground of error, he asserts the trial court erred in denying his Motion to Set Aside the Indictment for failing to provide a speedy trial. The state's reply to appellant's first ground of error includes an attack on the constitutionality of the Speedy Trial Act (the Act), Tex.Code Crim.Proc.Ann. ch. 32A (Vernon Supp.1985). Appellant complains in his second ground of error that the indictment is void because it violates Article 51.14 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure. In his final ground of error, appellant argues the trial court erroneously admitted evidence of prior acts of misconduct.\nAppellant and Dianna Israel, the state's complaining witness, were romantically involved during 1979.

Second Dist., Div. Three.  \nFeb. 14, 1966.\n Herbert M. Shyer for Defendant and Appellant.\n Thomas C. Lynch, Attorney General, William E. James, Assistant Attorney General, and Nicholas C. Yost, Deputy Attorney General, for Plaintiff and Respondent.\n SHINN, P. J.\n Appellant, Charles Battles, was convicted in a trial without jury of the crime of rape, consisting of having sexual intercourse with a female under 18 years of age who was not his wife. He was granted probation and appealed from the order as a judgment.\n [1] The act was admitted by appellant; his excuse was that he believed the young woman was of the age of consent (People v. Hernandez, 61 Cal.2d 529 [39 Cal.Rptr. 361, 393 P.2d 673]).\n The court, of course, had an opportunity to form an opinion as to the apparent age of the prosecutrix, and she appeared to the court to be so obviously under the age of consent *123 as to overcome the testimony of appellant that he honestly believed her to be of lawful age.\n It is argued in the brief that the prosecutrix not only deceived appellant by her appearance, her assurance of her maturity, and her manner, but that her simple attire and youthful deportment in court also deceived the judge.

The statute provides that a lienholder must pay the property owner any difference between the \"proceeds of the sale\" and the debt (including costs) secured by the lien. In this case, however, the district court has entered a judgment requiring the lienholder to pay a difference based not upon the \"proceeds of the sale\" but upon the full market value of the property. For reasons explained below, we vacate the judgment and remand the case.\n\nI\nThe facts are complex. We state them essentially as the district court found them. For several years, Comstock Investment Corporation moored a boat at a marina operated by the Kaniksu Resort. As a bailee, Kaniksu charged the boat owner $200 per year for moorage services. In 1975, some equipment on the boat was discovered to be missing. The bailee acknowledged...",

A state trooper advised him that if he refused the test his driver's license would be suspended for 90 days. Appellant refused. After consulting with the state attorney's office, a state trooper ordered the extraction of a blood sample which revealed a blood alcohol content of .20 percent. Appellant was not placed under arrest, but several weeks later was indicted by the Leon County Grand Jury upon two counts of manslaughter by reason of intoxication.\nThe trial court, over appellant's strenuous objections, instruct...",

Evidence adduced at the trial showed that she was caused to undergo two back operations, neither of which was successful, that she has a 40 per cent permanent disability and that she suffered from a congenital spine problem prior to the fall. The jury returned *281 a verdict of $25,000.00 for Margaret West, $10,000.00 for Julian West, and found Margaret to have been 50 per cent negligent. The verdict was reduced by that percentage and judgment was so entered.\nOn appeal, the plaintiffs contend that the court erred in failing to grant a new trial (1) because the verdict in favor of Margaret West was so grossly inadequate as to shock the conscience of the court, and (2) because the plaintiffs were prejudiced by the court's earlier denial of a motion ...",

At trial, the jury heard testimony from the occupants of a residence that they had been eating breakfast on their front porch when they heard their dog bark. They ran to the back of the house in time to see the appellant rapidly walk out of the bedroom. Upon being asked what he was doing, the appellant replied that he had been looking for \"a little short white guy, Mike, who came in.\" When asked to leave, appellant complied. One of the occupants testified that appellant behaved like \"a perfect gentleman.\" Nothing was taken from the house, and nothing had been disturbed.\nAppellant declined to testify at trial. During argument, his attorney conceded that appellant had been in the house but argued that nothing introduced at trial indicated that Kiper entered the house with larcenous intent and that the most appellant was guilty of was criminal trespass. At the conclusion of trial, the defense tendered two trespass instructions and a verdict form on that charge. The district court rejected \"the simple misdem...",

Jarvis, hereinafter referred to as defendant, was convicted in the District Court of Comanche County, Case No. CRF-71-158, with the offense of possession of marihuana and sentenced to three (3) years imprisonment. The judgment and sentence was imposed on April 11, 1971, and this appeal perfected therefrom.\nIt was charged by information that on March 30, 1971, the defendant and eight others were in joint possession of marihuana. The defendant was tried separately and convicted. The single assignment of error raised on appeal contends that the marihuana admitted at the defendant's trial, over objection, was the fruits of an unlawful search and seizure. The defendant argues that the search was conducted pursuant to a search warrant, which was issued pursuant to a constitutionally insufficient affidavit for search warrant. In reply, the State contends that the affidavit for search warrant was sufficient, or in the alternative that the defendant did not sustain his burden of proving the invalidity of the search.\nAfter describing the residence to be searched at 1610 \"D\" Street in Lawton, Oklahoma, the affidavit for search warrant sets forth the following fo...",

The Roarks appeal from both rulings. We affirm.\n\nI\nIn 1965 the city brought an action to condemn certain land owned by the Roarks. The city alleged that the land was \"necessary for the enlargement, improvement and maintenance of the Caldwell Municipal Airport\" and prayed for condemnation \"in fee simple absolute.\" The jury found the \"just compensation for the land condemned\" to be $12,500, and...",

The appeal was transferred to this court from the court of appeals pursuant to section 13-4-102(1)(b), 6A C.R.S. (1987), because Wells challenges the constitutionality of the violent crime sentencing provisions of section 16-11-309(1)(a), 8A C.R.S. (1986). Comparing section 16-11-309(1)(a), the provision under which he was sentenced, to section 16-11-309(1)(b), concerning certain crimes against the elderly or handicapped, he contends that the statutory sentencing scheme violates the equal protection guarantees of article II, section 25 of the Colorado Constitution because a lesser sentence is provided for crimes against the elderly or handicapped than is provided for crimes of violence.

Hutchens appeals from the trial court's denial of his motion for new trial, contending that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction of rape and that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance. We find no error and affirm.\n1. Hutchens contends that his rape conviction was not authorized by the evidence.\nOn appeal from a criminal conviction, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, and an appellant no longer enjoys the presumption of innocence. This court determines whether the evidence is sufficient under the standard of Jackson v. Virginia [,443 U.S. 307, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560 (1979)] and does not weigh the evidence or determine witness credibility. Conflicts in the evidence are for the jury to resolve.

Sec. 2113(d) (bank robbery by use of force, violence and intimidation).  Hood, convicted upon a plea of guilty, contends that the sentence was so excessive as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth Amendment and also a gross abuse of the discretion afforded the trial judge under Rule 32, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.1\n    \n    \n      2\n      Appellant Hood, acting with others pursuant to a well-laid plan, robbed a bank in Arkansas while armed with a deadly weapon and through the use of threats.  The bank's president or manager was taken as a hostage.  Hood made a confession following his capture which implicated others.  He entered a plea of guilty and received a fifteen-year sentence, well within the authorized penalty of not more than a $10,000 fine or 25 years imprisonment or both.  We find the assertion of cruel and unusual punishment...",

Brockett additionally appeals from a trial court order denying him postconviction relief and granting the State's motion for reconsideration. We affirm the judgment and order.\n¶ 2. In its reconsideration ruling, the trial court reversed a prior order granting Brockett a new trial based on the ineffective assistance of Brockett's original trial counsel. On appeal, Brockett argues that the trial court did not have the authority to hear the State's reconsideration motion. Alternatively, Brockett argues that the trial court erred by not requiring his presence at the reconsideration proceeding. We reject both...",

On 4 November 2002, defendant was babysitting Brian while Michelle was at work.

Defendant noticed that Brian's lips were blue and that Brian had no pulse and was not breathing.

Granted leave to file an out-of-time appeal by the DeKalb County Superior Court, Nguyen now appeals the superior court's denial of his motion for new trial, contending that the superior court: (1) erred by refusing to suppress his confession upon finding that he knowingly and intelligently waived his Miranda[2] rights, and (2) erred by allowing testimony describing him as \"in jail\" without giving a curative instruction thereonthis improperly putting his character in issue. Finding these claims of error to be without merit, we affirm.\n1. The record shows that although his court-appointed attorney advised him not to do so, Nguyen, who is Vietnamese, asked to make a statement to Detective John Germano at the conclusion of his preliminary hearing. He did so in broken, simple sentence English, later repeating his request to Detective Germano upon being driven back to confinement. Given Nguyen's repeated requests to make a statement, Detective Germano took Nguyen to police headquarters, placed him in an interview room, and using a telephone ...",

She appeals following the denial of her motion for new trial.\n1. Brown first challenges the sufficiency of the evidence as to her conviction for financial transaction card theft, arguing that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she was in possession of the cards at the time they were discovered during a search pursuant to a warrant, and that the State failed to prove that the cards came within the definition of a financial transaction card set forth in OCGA § 16-9-30.\n(a) Pursuant to OCGA § 16-9-31(a)(1), \"[a] person commits the offense of financial transaction card theft when: (1)[h]e takes, obtains, or withholds a financial transaction card from the person, possession, custody, or control of another without the cardholder's consent. . . .\"\nBrown argues that \"spatial proximity,\" i.e., being present in the apartment where the cards were found, was insufficient to establish her possession of the cards, and thus the evidence was insufficient to establish she withheld the cards from their owners.

Reese, were indicted on separate bills charging each with robbery and theft. The indictments arose out of an incident that occurred in Hamiltoban Township, Adams County, on September 29, 1973, when the appellants robbed and assaulted Charles M. Singley and Roy E. Currens. Both victims were struck about the head and face by the appellants and as a result sustained injuries requiring treatment. Mr. Currens, in fact, suffered a fractured jaw. Furthermore, currency and personal property having a total value of $300, more or less, was unlawfully taken from the victims.\nOn January 15, 1974, both appellants, pursuant to plea agreements entered into with the Commonwealth and accepted by the trial court, pleaded guilty to lesser included offenses of the crimes for which they were indicted  two counts each of robbery and theft.\nOn February 13, 1974, both appellants were sentenced as ...",

The second superseding indictment offered counts for conspiracy against civil rights in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 241; damage or destruction to religious real property in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 247(c); and use of fire to commit a felony in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 844(h)(1). On April 14, 2011, following a jury trial, Defendant was found guilty on all three charges.\nPrior to trial, Defendant moved to suppress certain inculpatory statements he made during a lengthy interview with law enforcement officers.[1] (Dkt. No. 129.) At the conclusion of an evidentiary hearing, the court ruled orally that motion was denied. This memorandum will set forth the reasons for the court's ruling both on Defendant's motion to suppress (Dkt. No. 129) and on his motion for reconsideration (Dkt. No. 237).\n\nII. FACTUAL BACK...",

California, Southern Division.\nSeptember 24, 2008.\n\nORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\nCORMAC J. CARNEY, District Judge.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\nDefendant Mitsubishi Digital Electronics America (\"MDEA\") moves for summary judgment on the claims alleged by Plaintiff Kelly Johnson for breach of express warranty,[1] fraudulent concealment, violation of California Business and Professions Code § 17200, and unjust enrichment. Mr. Johnson's claims all arise from his $3103.99 purchase of an MDEA television set from the New Jersey electronics store Camera Stop on November 6, 2005. Mr. Johnson's purchase of the television was based primarily on a conversation with a salesman at Camera Stop. He asked the salesperson at Camera Stop to recommend the best \"1080p\" television set on the market, and the salesperson pointed Mr. Johnson to the MDEA television. His sole contact with MDEA consisted of one visit to the MDEA Web site to check the television's price and confirm that it was 1080p.\nMr. Johnson wanted to buy a state-ofthe-art television and was apparently willing to spend more than $3,000 to get it. He knew that 1080p was the industry's marketing buzzword and allowed that to define his purchasing de...",

Defendant argues on appeal that the District Court should have declared a mistrial because of an unauthorized telephone conversation between a juror and a relative of one of the government's witnesses.  He also argues that the District Court erred in refusing to grant a mistrial based on a remark made by the Court to the effect that defendant's answer to a question seemed \"rehearsed.\"    On the issue of juror contact, defendant maintains that Budoff v.

Dinnan sued Haller, who is insured by plaintiff. Plaintiff brought this action for a declaratory judgment, *447 seeking a determination that it had no duty to defend or to indemnify given the criminal act exclusion contained in its policy. The trial court ruled in favor of Haller, concluding that the exclusion contravened the mandatory coverage requirements of the no-fault act, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.\nThe insurance policy at issue states that coverage for bodily injury and property damage arising out of a criminal act is excluded. The issue here is whether this exclusion contravenes the mandatory coverage requirements of the no-fault act.\nMCL 500.3009(1) provides that an automobile insurance policy must cover at least $20,000 worth of bodily injury liability in \"any 1 accident,\" and MCL...",

Appellant raised nine separate grounds that trial counsel was ineffective. We affirm all grounds without comment, with the exception of ground eight. As to this claim, appellant asserted counsel was ineffective for failure to investigate and call alibi witnesses. We find appellant's claim facially insufficient, but remand to the trial court to grant leave to amend.\nWhile appellant was on probation, he was arrested for his involvement in a burglary. During the subsequent violation of probation hearing, appellant was adjudicated guilty and sentenced to ten years in prison. Appellant then filed this timely motion for post-conviction relief. Appellant alleged in this motion, inter alia, that trial counsel was deficient for failing to interview or call alibi witnesses once the probation violation hearing commenced. Appellant's motion was silent as to the witness's identity, substance of testimony, availability to testify or the prejudicial effect of the witness failing to testify. As such, we find appellant's claim facially insufficient. See Nelson v. State, 875 So. 2d 579, 581-84 (F...",

Gusik, 6 Cir., 180 F.2d 662, that Gusik had not exhausted his remedies under the Articles of War because he had not availed himself of the new remedy provided by Article 53, 62 Stat. 639, now art. 73, 50 U.S.C.A. &#167; 660, and so ordered the dismissal of the writ.  Upon appeal, after grant of a petition for certiorari, the Supreme Court agreed with our views on the main issue tendered under Article 53 but directed a different disposition of the case.  Since trial in the district court had ended before the effective date of that Article, the court reversed and directed that we hold the case pending resort to the new remedy.  Gusik v.

Sheppard, Assistant District Attorney, for appellee.\nSMITH, Judge.\nHenry Marvin Stephens and three codefendants were indicted by a Richmond County grand jury on charges of armed robbery and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. The incident giving rise to the charges occurred during an undercover drug sale arranged by the Richmond County Sheriff's Department. At trial, the jury acquitted two codefendants and convicted Stephens and one codefendant. Stephens's motion for new trial was denied, and he appeals. Finding no harmful error, we affirm.\n1. While Stephens raises the general grounds, his argument on the sufficiency of the evidence is limited to the contention that the State failed to show the funds taken in the robbery were \"the property of the Richmond County Board of Commissioners\" as alleged in the indictment. Stephens incorrectly asserts that the only evidence in the record merely identified the funds as \"official government funds\" from the Sheriff's office without stating their source as federal, state or local government. Another witness clearly identified the money as \"Richmond County's.\"\nAs a technical matter, the board of commissioners is not identical to the county itself. See Aetna Cas., etc., Co. v. Shuman, 237 Ga. 403, 405, 22...",

Respondent came in contact with Volker Schneider (\"Schneider\"), who invested $480,000 into the deal in February 1997.

The two of them were living in a bona fide state of separation at the time of the murder, and the appellant's burglary conviction was based on the allegation in the indictment that the appellant entered into the victim's dwelling with the intent to commit the offense of murder therein. The state sought imposition of the death penalty under OCGA § 17-10-30 (b) (2), on the ground that the murder was committed while the offender was engaged in the commission of burglary. Although the jury found in its verdict that the appellant had unlawfully entered the victim's dwelling with the intent to commit the felony of murder therein, the jury did not impose the death penalty. Consequently, the appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder conviction, and he was given a concurrent 20-year sentence for the burglary conviction.\nIn his direct appeal to this Court, the appellant's enumerations of error present issues concerning whether, under the substantive double-jeopardy law of this stat...",

On July 8, 1987, one week after appellant was charged, the State filed an application for determination of competency. See 22 O.S. 1981, § 1175.2. At the hearing on the application, the trial court found appellant's competence questionable and ordered him to undergo professional mental evaluation at Eastern State Hospital. See 22 O.S.Supp. 1987, § 1175.3(D). After appellant had been evaluated, the court held a post-examination competency hearing pursuant to 22 O.S.Supp. 1987, § 1175.4. Appellant did not request a jury trial on the issue of competency and the trial was thus held before the judge. At the close of this proceeding, the court found appellant \"incompetent, but capable of achieving competency within a reasonable period of time... .\" 22 O.S. 1981, § 1175.7(A).

A 1980 Chevrolet was found caught on a retaining wall in the parking lot and a 1971 Mercedes was missing. About 6:30 p. m. the evening of September 22, acting on a tip from an informant, police located the defendant and the Mercedes in the vicinity of Ollie and Harwell Streets in Atlanta. Detective Larry Loy testified that he observed Thomas and his co-defendant, Andrew Spanky Howard, walking toward Ollie Street carrying an exhaust pipe and the mufflers from the Mercedes. A few minutes later Loy spotted the car parked down the block on the wrong side of the street. Thomas was outside the car on the passenger side when Loy approached, pulled out his weapon and badge and announced that both persons were under arrest. Loy stated that both men \"started to run,\" but before Thomas \"could take probably one step\" Loy held him and placed him under arrest; there was a \"slight struggle . . .

The State contends that its subsequent indictment of Jackson was not barred by its earlier nolle prosequi of its first indictment, which occurred after the State discovered a fatal variance between the indictment and the facts it presented at trial. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.\nThe record shows that the State charged Jackson with one count of burglary as part of a multi-count indictment against several individuals. During trial, and after the jury was sworn and witnesses had testified, the prosecuting attorney realized that the evidence presented against Jackson did not conform to the indictment because it showed a different residence, date, and accomplice than the offense alleged in the indictment. Over the objection of defense counsel, the trial court granted the State permission to nolle prosequi the indictment against Jackson. The State subsequently obtained a new indictment against Jackson that charged him with committing burglary in a manner consistent with the evidence presented in the earlier trial. Jackson filed a plea in bar and plea of former jeopardy,[1] which the trial court granted.\nThe...",

(Mack).\nThe facts as developed at trial established that in early 1976, Mid-America wrote several large truck manufacturers, including Brockway, seeking to obtain a distributorship. All of the manufacturers replied that they were not interested in granting Mid-America a distributorship at that time. Brockway, however, on April 12, 1976, wrote to Mid-America stating that they had reevaluated the Mid-America application and that the granting of a distributorship was possible after a credit check and other necessary steps were taken.\nJoe Helf and Marion Brown, officers of Mid-America, went to the home office of Brockway in...",

He appealed to the Regional Director of the Bureau of Prisons, and the appeal was denied on the basis that he must pursue the tort claim which he had filed, the administrative remedy procedure not being the proper method.

BMI filed a reply (document # 28) December 10, 1992.\nBMI contends that because it seeks only injunctive and statutory relief, the action is of a purely equitable nature and therefore that the Seventh Amendment does not require a jury trial. The Ninth Circuit has *1353 not squarely addressed the issue of when a jury trial is appropriate in a copyright infringement case and there is conflicting authority on this question; however, two cases, Sid &amp; Marty Krofft Television v. McDonald's Corp., 562 F.2d 1157 (9th Cir.1977) and Video Views, Inc. v. Studio 21, LTD., 925 F.2d 1010 (7th Cir.1991) when read together strongly suggest that questions of fact regarding liability may be decided by a jury and that the amount of damages should be set by the court.\nIn Sid &amp; ...",

The Treasury Department disallowed the deductions, and he paid under protest the additional tax.

They planned to sell a house on Southern Avenue and to share the proceeds equally. Appellee would live in the other house (which had been their marital domicile), located on 32d Street, and pay appellant for her half interest in that property. By the terms of the separation agreement, both properties were to be appraised “by an independent appraiser agreeable to both parties.” If the parties could not agree on an appraiser, “either party [could] petition the court to have an appraiser appointed.”\nAppellee submitted the names of three independent and qualified appraisers to appellant for her approval. She rejected all three suggestions made by her former husband, and countered by offering the name Joe R. McCray, a real estate broker. Ap-pellee consented to her choice. McCray visited the properties and delivered his complete appraisal of the two houses to the parties. He appraised the Southern Avenue house at $29,600 and the 32d Street house at $52,700. Appellant maintained that McCray’s appraisal of the 32d Street...",

Bullen, Assistant Public Defender, Media, for appellant.\nD. Michael Emuryan, Deputy District Attorney, Media, for Commonwealth, appellee.\n*61 Before CERCONE, President Judge, and ROBERTS and LIPEZ, JJ.[*]\nPER CURIAM:\nOn May 5, 1976, a court sitting without jury convicted appellant, Kevin Evans, of murder of the second degree, robbery, burglary and theft by unlawful taking. After denying post-verdict motions, the court sentenced appellant to life imprisonment on the murder charge and suspended sentence on the charges of robbery and burglary. Appellant seeks a new trial on the grounds that the trial court deprived him of effective representation and equal protection by denying his request for appointment of a consulting psychiatrist at state expense to aid in the preparation of his defense and that an inculpatory statement he gave police should have been suppressed as involuntary and improperly obtained from a juvenile. We affirm.\nIn November, 1975, police discovered the body of a 95 year old woman in her home not far from appellant's residence. During the investigation that day, appellant's brother appeared and told the officers that his mother wished to talk with them. The officers answered the request and, when they found in the house certain evidence linking appellant to the crime, requested that he ...",

However, plaintiffs' relation and responsibilities to each successive landlord were practically the same. They were the tenants of the defendant until Nieman sold out to the Kiekhaefer Corporation. They became tenants of the Kiekhaefer Corporation when that corporation purchased the premises during the lease term, on December 29, 1950, and *445 took the real estate subject to such rights as then existed in the plaintiffs. Plaintiffs were tenants in possession. That possession was \"actual, open, notorious, and visible possession\" by the plaintiffs and constituted constructive notice to the purchaser, the Kiekhaefer Corporation.

The Court sentenced Fenton as a persistent felony and drug offender, to two life sentences and two fifty-year sentences. Fenton filed a Rule 29.15 motion, which the Court denied, after an evidentiary hearing.\nOn appeal, Fenton argues that the Court erred when it denied his Rule 29.15 motion. Fenton argues that his trial counsel *9 was ineffective, because: 1) trial counsel failed to request a speedy trial; 2) trial counsel failed to ask the Court to instruct the jury to disregard Fenton's unkempt appearance; and 3) trial counsel failed to evaluate his mental state and competency to stand trial.

Judge GREGORY wrote a dissenting opinion.\nOPINION\nDEVER, District Judge:\nFrom 1860 to 1863, the federal budget grew dramatically due to spending associated with the Civil War. Sadly, some unscrupulous people viewed the growing federal budget as a font to be plundered. *247Congress held hearings and learned that federal treasure had been spent on decrepit horses and mules, weapons that would not fire, rancid rations, and phantom supplies. In response, in 1863, Congress enacted the False Claims Act (“FCA”). When enacted, the Department of Justice did not exist, and federal law enforcement fell to Attorney General Edward Bates and his staff in Washington, D.C., as well as to the then-independent U.S. Attorneys in each federal judicial district. In enacting the FCA, Congress included qui tam provisions authorizing private citizens (known as qui tam relators) to use the FCA to file suit on behalf of the United States and to share in any recovery from the fraudsters.\nAlthough the FCA proved a somewhat useful tool for returning ill-gotten gains to the United States Treasury, courts issued a number of rulings narrowing the construction of the FCA. Thus, in 1986, Congress amended the FCA in order to revise and strengthen it, particularly the FCA’s qui tam provisions. Since the 1986 Amendments, relators have filed a dramatically larger number of qui tam actions, and due in large measur...",

As so modified, order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements to defendant.\nPlaintiff's first cause of action alleges that section 52 of the Suffolk County Tax Act was not complied with in that, as required by subdivision 1 of section 1014 of the Real Property Tax Law, the redemption price listed in the published notice to redeem did not include the amounts paid by defendant subsequent to the tax sale pursuant to section 75 of the Suffolk County Tax Act (L. 1929, ch. 152). However, it is possible for these amounts to be paid by the tax sale purchaser subsequent to the publication of such notice and prior to the expiration of the redemption period (cf. Real Property Tax Law, § 1014, subd. 1). Also, the amounts paid by defendant represent delinquent taxes on plaintiff's property; and plaintiff received notice on his tax bills that these amounts were outstanding. For the foregoing reasons, we hold that such amounts were not intended to be included in the published notice to redeem (cf. Real ...",

There is no requirement\n                under NRS Chapter 34 for a petitioner to take further action after the\n                filing of the petition.

Boyden, Salt Lake, for ami-cus Ute Indian Tribe.\n\n## 인용\n\n- 858 P.2d 927\n\n## 판결문 요약\n\n\nSTEWART, Justice:\nClinton Perank was convicted in a state court of committing a burglary in Myton, Utah, in violation of Utah Code Ann. § 76-6-202 (1978), and placed on probation. The court thereafter revoked his probation and ordered him committed to the Utah State Prison for a term of 0-5 years. Perank appealed from the revocation of probation, and we stayed execution of the sentence pending appeal.1\nPerank argues that the state trial court lacked jurisdiction to convict him of burglary and that the Ute Tribal Court had exclusive jurisdiction because he is an Indian and the offense occurred within Indian country. Two issues are presented: (1) whether Perank is an Indian and (2) whether the Uintah-Ouray Indian Reservation was diminished by an act of Congress, leaving Myton, Utah, outside the jurisdictional boundaries of that Reservation.\nEven though Perank pleaded guilty to the burglary charge and did not raise the issue of lack of subject matter jurisdiction with respect to the burglary until the probation revocation proceeding, the issue is properly before this Court. A plea of guilty does not waive a claim that the court lacks power to adjudicate a charge against the defendant. Blackledge v. Perry, 417 U.S. 21, 30-31, 94 S.Ct. 2098, 2103-04, 40 L.Ed.2d 628 (1974); see also 1 Charles A. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure § 175, at 623-33 (1982).

Burns Jr., for appellant.\nSpencer Lawton Jr., District Attorney, Jonathan V. Dunn, Assistant District Attorney, for appellee.\nBARNES, Chief Judge.\nEdward Dewberry appeals his conviction of burglary and three counts of armed robbery. Dewberry contends the trial court erred in limiting the cross-examination of a State's witness, thereby denying him his right to a thorough and sifting cross-examination in violation of OCGA § 24-9-64 and its constitutional counterparts. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.\nFollowing Dewberry's conviction, he filed a motion for a new trial contending that the trial court erred in limiting his ability to cross-examine a State's witness and that the verdict was contrary to the evidence. The motion was subsequently denied and Dewberry's first appeal followed. In that appeal, however, Dewberry restricted his complaint only to allegations that he received ineffective assistance of counsel and that the verdict was contrary to the evidence. No error regarding a restriction on Dewberry's right to cross-examine a witness was enumerated in his initial appeal. In an unpublished opinion, this court found no error and affirmed the trial court's decision that the verdict was not contrary to the evidence, but remanded the case to the trial court to consider Dewberry's allegation regarding ineffectiveness of counsel because that error had no...",

We reverse.\n      At his trial for first degree residential robbery, Tamborrino took the stand in his own defense.   Tamborrino's testimony contradicted the testimony of Deborah Clarke, who was the robbery victim and the prosecution's chief witness, that she had not previously met Tamborrino.   Tamborrino testified that he had sold Clarke \"bunk\" cocaine and that his fingerprint, which was found on her jewelry box, must have been made at that time.   Over defense counsel's objections, the trial judge then questioned Tamborrino about whether he had told his counsel the story that he had just related on the stand.   See People v.

The record on appeal was docketed by the defendant in this Court on 2 January 1969. Ninety days from the date of this judgment expired on 18 December 1968. The defendant did not procure an extension of time in which to docket the record on appeal. Therefore, this appeal may be dismissed under Rule 48 of the Rules of Practice in the Court of Appeals for failure to comply with Rule 5.\nOn 23 December 1968 the plaintiff duly filed a motion in accordance with Rule 17 to docket and dismiss the appeal for failure to comply with Rule 5. The defendant filed an answer to this motion. In support of the contention that the motion should be denied, counsel for the defendant relies upon an order procured from Judge Clark which extended the time for serving the case on appeal upon the plaintiff. However, counsel for the defendant has confused the time allowed for serving a case on appeal with the time allowed for docketing a record on appeal in this Court.

After a series of unsuccessful attempts at post-trial relief in state court, Donald filed a petition for habeas corpus in federal district court in Massachusetts.[1] His petition set forth two general categories of alleged constitutional infirmities in the state court proceedings.

During the pendency of his habeas petition, Donald proffered a motion for discovery, seeking access to various pieces of physical evidence which Donald wanted to subject to DNA testing more advanced than that performed prior to his trial.

Defendant appeals contending that the trial court erred in denying his motion for new trial. Held:\n1. The usual general grounds of the motion for new trial are deemed abandoned inasmuch as there is no argument or citation of authority raised which is relevant to such issues. Rule 15 (c) (2); Code Ann. § 24-3615 (c) (2).\n2. Due to the absence of any special plea of insanity, the *567 defendant's request for a psychiatric examination lay within the discretion of the trial court, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying the request.

Petitioner argued that she was denied a fundamentally fair trial in violation of due process because the local Michigan police disposed of certain exculpatory evidence which was material to her defense.   The Michigan Court of Appeals rejected the argument, and the Michigan Supreme Court denied petitioner's application for delayed appeal, holding that the application was received beyond the Court's two month deadline.

Snook contends that in ordering him to make restitution under the Victim and Witness Protection Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3663-64, the district court erred by failing to consider his ability to repay $3,307,491.69.   We decline to consider this contention because Snook stipulated to a higher restitution amount in his plea agreement and did not object at sentencing.  See United States v. DeSalvo, 41 F.3d 505, 511 (9th Cir.1994) (generally, restitution issue not raised before district court will not be addressed on appeal).\n    \n    \n      3\n      AFFIRMED.\n    \n    \n      \n        *\n         The panel unanimously finds this case suitable for decision without oral argument.

The district court granted summary judgment for the Pettitts, concluding that GHOA did not have standing to condemn the property because traffic safety matters had been legislatively delegated to the Nevada Department of Transportation (NDOT). GHOA contends that it has power to condemn the land for construction of a roadway. We agree, and reverse the district court's decision and remand with instructions to enter summary judgment for GHOA.\n\nFACTS\nGHOA is a non-profit corporation formed for the mutual benefit and protection of its members and to enforce the Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions (CC &amp; Rs) of the Glenbrook community. Under the CC &amp; Rs, GHOA owns and is responsible for maintenance of the common areas and roads within the community. On February 2, 1978, the Pettitts purchased property from Glenbrook and constructed a home.\nIn 1991, responding to safety conc...",

The trial court sentenced the Defendant to an effective sentence\nof life imprisonment plus fifteen years. On appeal, the Defendant contends that the trial court erred\nwhen it: (1) used an improper legal standard for an insanity defense because it required the\nDefendant to prove both that he was unable to appreciate the nature of his acts and that he was\nunable to appreciate the wrongfulness of his acts; and (2) sentenced the Defendant to consecutive\nsentences.
